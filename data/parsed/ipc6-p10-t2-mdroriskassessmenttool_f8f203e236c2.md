The Multi-Drug Resistant Organisms (MDROs) Risk Assessment Tool was designed to assist accommodating MDRO positive residents in various situations. The tool will help to determine which MDRO positive residents should be in private rooms (when possible) and also how to accommodate MDRO positive residents when private rooms are not available.

### For MDRO Positive Residents:
1. Complete this form for each MDRO positive resident in the home.
2. Add up the identified risks and fill in the SCORE at the top of the form.
3. Individual scores can be compared to determine who is at highest risk of transmission.
4. ARO positive residents with the higher scores should be considered first for private room accommodations and considered last for cohorting situations.

### For Non-MDRO Potential Roommates:
1. Complete this form only for each roommate that is being considered to cohort with an MDRO positive resident.
2. Add up the identified risks and fill in the SCORE at the top of the form.
3. Potential roommate scores can be compared to determine who is at least risk of acquiring an MDRO.
4. The resident with the lowest score should be the first choice for cohorting with the MDRO positive resident.
