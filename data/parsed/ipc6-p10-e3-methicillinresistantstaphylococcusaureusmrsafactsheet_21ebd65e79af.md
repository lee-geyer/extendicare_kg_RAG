# Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA)

## Resident Information
Please read this fact sheet and ask staff if you have any questions.

### WHAT IS MRSA?
Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium that may commonly live on the nose, skin, and moist areas of the body. MRSA is the term used for Staphylococcus aureus bacteria that have become resistant to some types of penicillin.

MRSA can live on the nose, skin, and moist areas of the body without causing illness, known as colonization. The individual who is colonized is sometimes called a carrier.

### WHY THE CONCERN?
Medications used to treat infections with strains of Staphylococcus aureus are not always effective against MRSA. This can make any infection with MRSA difficult to treat.

### WILL I GET AN MRSA INFECTION?
Infections occur when bacteria get past a person’s normal defenses (e.g., skin bacteria getting into a wound). Infections with MRSA may be minor, such as pimples or boils. Serious infections may also occur, such as wound infections and pneumonia.

### HOW CAN THE SPREAD OF MRSA BE PREVENTED?
It is possible for a person who is colonized or infected with MRSA to spread the bacteria to others. You may be placed on special precautions. This means that the home will take measures to help prevent the bacteria from spreading.

### WHAT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY AND VISITORS?
You may still have visitors. They may be asked to put on gloves and wear a gown over their clothes. This gown should be removed before your visitors leave your room. It is very important that your visitors wash their hands before they leave your room.

### WHAT CAN YOU DO?
- Wash your hands well and frequently.
- Your cooperation with the special precautions in place is most appreciated.

## WHAT IS MRSA?
Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium that may commonly live on the nose, skin, and moist areas of the body. MRSA is the term used for Staphylococcus aureus bacteria that have become resistant to some types of penicillin. Medications used to treat infections with strains of Staphylococcus aureus are not always effective against MRSA. This can make any infection with MRSA difficult to treat.

## HOW IS MRSA SPREAD?
MRSA bacteria are spread through direct person-to-person contact with a colonized or infected person. It can be passed from hands that are not clean to any person, object, or surface they touch. When hands are washed thoroughly or rubbed with alcohol-based hand sanitizer, MRSA will likely be removed. Frequent hand washing is necessary to either prevent spreading MRSA to others, or to prevent picking it up from others.

## WHAT CAN BE DONE TO PREVENT SPREAD OF MRSA?
The home may take special or additional infection control precautions. The most important thing you can do is wash your hands before and after visiting to prevent spreading MRSA to others, or to prevent picking it up from others.

## CAN I TOUCH THE PERSON I AM VISITING?
Yes, you can still have close contact, such as hugging, kissing, and handholding. You may be asked to put on gloves and wear a gown over your clothes. This gown should be removed before you leave the resident’s room. Please remember to wash your hands before entering and leaving a resident’s room. If you have questions, please ask staff.
