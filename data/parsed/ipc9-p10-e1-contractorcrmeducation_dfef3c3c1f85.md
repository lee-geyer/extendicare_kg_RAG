# Construction, Renovation and Maintenance

- Construction, renovation, and maintenance activities (CRM) have been linked to the spread of infections in long-term care homes.
- Disrupting the structures of the long-term care home and creating dust can lead to the spread of fungus (e.g., Aspergillus) and other infections (e.g., Legionellosis).
- Mortality rates associated with construction-linked outbreaks are high.
- IPAC preventive measures must be planned, implemented, and evaluated before, during, and at the end of CRM activities in accordance with CSA Z317.13.

# Legionella

- **Bacteria** that live in water and soil
- Causes **Legionnaires’ disease**, a dangerous type of pneumonia
- **Mortality rate** can be as high as 25-40%
- In the fall of 2005, an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease swept the **Seven Oaks Home for the Aged** in Toronto, infecting:
- 70 residents
- 39 staff
- 21 visitors
- Five other people who lived or worked nearby
- **Twenty-three residents died.**

# Aspergillus

- A common mould (a type of fungus) that lives indoors and outdoors
- Survives in soil and dust, and can be airborne when disturbed
- Can lead to outbreaks of a fatal lung infection called invasive aspergillosis
- Mortality rate can exceed 40%

# Infection Control Risk Assessment (ICRA)

- The home’s interdisciplinary team (IDT) will evaluate the risks of the construction work using an Infection Control Risk Assessment (ICRA).
- The evaluation considers the type of construction work (called **Construction/Renovation Activity Type**) and the risk to the residents (called **Population Risk Group**).
- Based on that, the IDT will determine the necessary infection control measures needed to keep everyone safe.

# Infection Control Risk Assessment (ICRA) cont’d

- The infection control measures in the ICRA must be followed in the home, and during the entire period of the construction work.
- It is the responsibility of all workers to follow the infection control measures and address any issues.
- The home may also complete audits of the construction zone to ensure that all the appropriate infection control measures are being followed.

# How can you help decrease the risks?

- Follow all the infection control measures
- Inform management of any breaches in the infection control measures
- Help restrict the access of residents and visitors to any construction zone
- Avoid resident care areas and follow the predetermined traffic route only
- Keep the construction zone clear of clutter

# Controlling Dust and Debris

- All workers should clean their clothes with a HEPA vacuum or remove their construction clothes before leaving the work zone.
- Avoid walking in the home with dusty boots, clothes, or equipment.
- All construction debris must be contained and covered before transport and removed at least daily.
- All sticky mats and walk-off mats must be replaced/cleaned as required.

# Routine Practices and Outbreaks

- Clean your hands upon arrival and frequently while in the home.
- If you are ill or feel sick, please do not come to the home.
- If you start to feel ill while in the home, please leave.
- Wear personal protective equipment (PPE) as required by the home.

## Important Notice

**THIS HOME IS IN OUTBREAK**
Do not visit if you are sick.

- Clean your hands when entering and leaving the home.
- Visiting the home may be restricted. Please check with the front desk or staff.

# Respiratory Etiquette

Part of Routine Practices includes using respiratory etiquette:

## Coughing & Sneezing Best Practices

- **Move it**: Move away from others when you feel a sneeze or cough coming on.
- **Catch it**:
- Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue.
- If you don’t have one, cough or sneeze into your sleeve or elbow; not your hands.
- **Bin it**:
- Discard any used tissue in a garbage bin.
- **Kill it**:
- Wash or sanitize hands immediately.
- Remember to rub hands for a minimum of 15 seconds.

## Stop the Spread of Infection

Infections (such as influenza, COVID-19, cold viruses, and even whooping cough) are spread by coughing and sneezing. When you cough or sneeze into your hands, your hands carry and spread these infectious agents. When you touch an object such as a door handle, elevator button, telephone, or computer keyboard with unclean hands, you are spreading germs. The next person who touches these objects may pick up these germs and get sick if they do not clean their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
