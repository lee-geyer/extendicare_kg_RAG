## Expected vs. Unexpected Death
### Summary of Death Classification and Reporting in LTC Homes
This summary provides an overview of how deaths in LTC homes are classified and the reporting requirements under the Coroners Act. Understanding the difference between natural and non-natural deaths is essential for ensuring timely and appropriate reporting.

### Expected Death (Natural)
In the event of an expected death of a resident, the nurse may pronounce death as per their respective regulatory bodies. They must notify the family if not present and then contact the attending physician to release the body and provide any other required directions.

#### Definition: "EXPECTED DEATH (Natural)"
- A death resulting from disease or its complications, without significant contribution from an injury.
- Expected by the residents, family, and healthcare team, with planning and documentation in place.
- Most deaths in LTC are classified as natural or expected, even if no obvious decline or end-of-life orders were present.

If the nurse answers “NO” to all the below questions AND the death is expected, the nurse may pronounce death.

| Question                                                                 | YES | NO |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|----|
| Was the death Accidental Death?                                          |     |    |
| An accident is an event that caused unintended injuries that begin the process leading to death. The time interval between the injury & death may be minutes to years. For example, a hip fracture is a common injury that begins the process that leads to death in the elderly. If there is a possible connection between a fracture or an injury & the events leading to death, the cause of death is uncertain (e.g., choking, fall with head injuries), the death should be reported to the local coroner. |     |    |
| Was the Death result of violence, accident, suicide, improper or negligent treatment by any person, or poisoning? |     |    |
| Was the death both sudden & unexpected?                                  |     |    |
| Unexpected death is when the deceased was in apparent good health.      |     |    |
| Was the manner of death unclear?                                         |     |    |
| There is some reason to think that the death may not be due to natural causes, but it is not clearly an accident, a suicide, or a homicide. |     |    |

*Refers to Registered Nurse, Registered Practical Nurse, Licensed Practical Nurse*

Under no circumstances may a nurse pronounce death when the death is unexpected. In certain situations, even though the death was expected, the coroner (and possibly other regulatory authorities) will need to be notified.

# Expected vs. Unexpected Death

An unexpected death occurs when an individual who appears healthy dies suddenly within minutes or hours due to a pre-existing condition or functional disorder. It includes deaths resulting from accidents, mistreatment, neglect, violence, or causes unrelated to an expected death.

## Non-Natural Death Categories

A non-natural death falls under one of four categories:

| Category      | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Accident      | An unintended injury contributes to death (e.g., a fall leading to a fatal head injury). |
| Suicide       | A self-inflicted injury results in death (e.g., intentional medication overdose). |
| Homicide      | Death is caused by another person’s actions (e.g., complications from an assault). |
| Undetermined   | Insufficient evidence prevents classification (e.g., a fatal fall after an unwitnessed altercation). |

**Note:** If staff are in doubt as to the manner of death, they shall notify the coroner.

## Sudden and Unexpected Deaths

- Defined as deaths that were not reasonably foreseeable based on the individual’s medical history.
- Not all sudden deaths require reporting—only those that are also unanticipated given the disease progression.

### Key Considerations:

- Resident’s medical history (pre-existing conditions contributing to sudden death?)
- Recent changes in health status (any unexpected deterioration?)
- Circumstances of death (was it witnessed or unexplained?)

## Recognizing Changes in Condition

- A change in health condition before death may indicate the need for reporting.
- If the decline is unexpected or unanticipated, staff should consult a coroner.
- Interprofessional collaboration is essential—care teams should discuss changes to assess reporting needs.

## Final Considerations

- LTC staff must carefully assess deaths to determine if they require direct coroner reporting.
- If in doubt, the coroner will decide if further investigation is needed.
- Resources and tools are available to assist in tracking and evaluating health changes before death.

By understanding these classifications and reporting obligations, LTC staff can ensure compliance with the Coroners Act while upholding their duty to provide quality care and oversight in death reporting.

# Expected vs. Unexpected Death

## Case 1
**Circumstances:**
A 90-year-old female resident is found dead in bed by a PSW during morning rounds. She was semi-prone, with no evidence of injury or restraints.

**Changes in Condition:**
The resident was her usual self the night before, required no nighttime assistance, and had a medical history of dementia, angina, and arthritis. Staff and family had no concerns.

**True or False:**
This death should be reported directly to a coroner?
**False.** This is an apparent natural death due to likely heart disease. The death can be reported via the RDN, but the coroner does not need to be directly notified.

----

## Case 2
**Circumstances:**
An 82-year-old male resident fell in the bathroom while using a walker, suffered a hip fracture, underwent surgery, and returned to the LTC home a week later.

**Medical History:**
- Parkinson’s Disease
- Ischemic heart disease
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

**Changes in Condition:**
The resident recovered their previous level of function before later developing aspiration pneumonia and dying four months after the fall.

**True or False:**
This death should be reported directly to a coroner?
**False.** The resident had fully recovered from their injury before developing complications of a chronic illness. If complications from the injury had persisted, a coroner should be consulted.

----

## Case 3
**Circumstances:**
An 86-year-old female resident was pushed by another resident, resulting in a fall and fractures to the pelvis and ribs. She was treated conservatively at the LTC home.

**Medical History:**
- Dementia
- Osteoporosis
- Atrial fibrillation
- Blood thinner use

**Changes in Condition:**
Due to immobility, she developed skin breakdown, a urinary tract infection, and later died of urosepsis two months after the altercation.

**True or False:**
This death should be reported directly to a coroner?
**True.** This death is due to complications of an inflicted injury and should be classified as a homicide.

----

## Case 4
**Circumstances:**
A 62-year-old male resident had lived in LTC for 20 years due to injuries from a motor vehicle collision at age 34.

**Medical History:**
- Brain and spinal injuries
- Requiring complete care
- Non-verbal
- Feeding tube for dysphagia
- Suprapubic catheter for atonic bladder

**Changes in Condition:**
The resident died of urosepsis, likely related to the catheter.

**True or False:**
This death should be reported directly to a coroner?
**True.** The individual’s death was due to long-term complications from a prior injury. This makes it a non-natural death classified as an accident.

----

By carefully evaluating medical history, changes in condition, and the circumstances of death, LTC staff can ensure accurate and timely reporting in compliance with the Coroners Act.
