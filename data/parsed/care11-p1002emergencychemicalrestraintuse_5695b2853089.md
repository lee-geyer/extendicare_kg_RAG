## POLICY

### Restraint and PASD Use

### PROCEDURE

The goal of this procedure is to act as a standardized protocol for emergency and chemical restraint use to ensure an ethical approach that aligns with legislative and provincial and regional health authority requirements.

### Definitions:

#### Emergency Restraint
Physical or chemical methods used to prevent imminent serious harm to the resident or others based on exhibited risk behaviours that cannot be controlled through less restrictive measures.

#### Chemical Restraint
Use of medication for the primary purpose of sedating, controlling a resident’s behaviour, or restricting freedom of movement, rather than treating diagnosed behavioural and/or mental health symptoms.

- Psychotropic medications ordered as a part of a resident’s treatment plan for the management of diagnosed behavioural or mental health symptoms are not classified as a chemical restraint. These medications include:
- Sedatives
- Hypnotics
- Antipsychotics
- Antidepressants
- Anxiolytic medications

- Psychotropic medications ordered for their off-label, non-standard use (i.e., used differently than indications specified by Health Canada) are not considered chemical restraints.

- Psychotropic medications ordered in the absence of a supporting mental health diagnosis are considered chemical restraints and will be subject to Extendicare’s restraint protocols.

- Emergency restraints may be considered for a resident who exhibits responsive behaviours posing immediate and serious risk to their safety or the safety of others, after all other alternatives, including non-pharmacological interventions have been trialed to attempt to de-escalate, distract or calm the resident.

- The nurse will complete a Restraint & PASD Assessment & Evaluation for the implementation of any emergency restraint, which includes precipitating factors.

### Policy Guidelines

- Every effort will be made to notify the SDM/POA, where applicable, prior to implementation of the restraint, unless contraindicated in an emergency where Common Law Duty can be enacted and the resident and/or SDM/POA will not have the right to refuse.

- An order for the implementation of an emergency physical restraint must be obtained by an approved health care professional as soon as possible or as required, within 12 hours.

- An order will be obtained by the nurse prior to the administration of an emergency chemical restraint and document the circumstance preceding restraint use, the order, drug, dose, time administered, and effectiveness in eMar/paper MAR where applicable.

- Continuous 1:1 monitoring will be implemented and a behavioural monitoring tool (e.g., DOS tool) initiated to observe and document the residents’ ongoing behaviour.

- The nurse will monitor and assess the resident as per provincial and health authority regulations while the emergency restraint is in effect to assess and determine the resident's physical and emotional response to restraint use, which will be documented on the Restraint Utilization & Response Tool.

- Circumstances necessitating the need for an emergency restraint will be communicated to the SDM/POA where applicable within 24 hours. If use exceeds 24 hours, the resident/SDM/POA and DOC/ADOC designate must complete a Restraint & PASD Consent Form.

- Emergency restraints will only be utilized for the duration of the circumstances that led to the implementation.

- Re-evaluation will be conducted prior to discontinuation of an emergency restraint, to review appropriateness of the intervention, risk analysis, care plan interventions, and revisions for management of the circumstances that led to the emergency restraint implementation to limit future restraint use.

- Note, a chemical restraint can only be considered ‘removed’ when the effects of the medication are no longer present.

- An emergency chemical restraint will only be reordered as determined required upon completion of a physical assessment by the physician and/or nurse practitioner.

- The DOC/ADOC designate will include the utilization of any emergency physical or chemical restraints on the Restraint & PASD Monthly Analysis.
