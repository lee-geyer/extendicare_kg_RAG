From contractors to management, environmental services to front line staff, and infection prevention and control; we all have a part to play to keep our residents, visitors, and staff safe while construction projects are occurring.

4. **How Does IPAC assess Risk?**
A systematic tool called the Infection Control Risk Assessment (ICRA) supports risk assessment.

5. **At what phase of CRM activities/projects is IPAC involved?**
IPAC needs to be involved from the planning phase and throughout all phases of the CRM activities/projects.

6. **What infections are associated with IPAC during CRM activities/projects?**
Fungal infections (e.g., aspergillosis) or bacterial infections (e.g., legionella).

7. **What documents are to be completed after CRM activities/projects ended in the home?**
Infection Control Risk Assessment (ICRA) which will identify the Population Risk Group, Construction/Renovation Activity Type, and what Preventive Measures are required.

# IPAC during Construction Renovation and Maintenance (CRM)

## 9. Who should be involved in the planning of CRM activities/projects?
In the IPAC Manual IPC9.

## 10. What should be used to audit the Preventive Measures during the life of the project? Is there a mandatory checklist to be used?
Any CRM activities/projects should involve an interdisciplinary team (e.g., IPAC, Nursing, Management, Environmental Services, etc.). Depending on the size of the project, the size of the interdisciplinary team (IDT) will vary. For small CRM activities/projects (e.g., painting or changing a ceiling tile), the IDT can be simply composed of the maintenance personnel and IPAC. For larger projects, the IDT should involve management and multiple departments (i.e., it cannot just fall on IPAC and/or maintenance only). As a general guideline, any activities/projects that require Preventive Measures III & IV must have a large IDT during the planning process.

## 11. Who should be included in the education on the involvement of IPAC during CRM activities/projects?
At this time, the only mandatory documents that are included in the policy will be:
- **Appendix 1** – Infection Control Risk Assessment (ICRA)
- **Appendix 2** – Final Construction Clean checklist.

The Guidebook that is affiliated with the policy will house checklists that the home can use to audit the processes taking place during the life of the project; however, the home can construct their own checklist if they so choose. As long as there is detailed, documented evidence of an audit taking place daily, the home is considered in compliance.

## 12. Who do I reach out to if I have any questions?
While there needs to be an ICRA for all CRM activities/projects in the home, there is no need to start a new ICRA for every single work (especially for minor maintenance work that requires Preventive Measures I & II). The home can opt to re-use previous ICRAs if the work being planned is going to be similar in scope and requires the same preventive measures. For example, if the home has created an ICRA to address painting in one of the residents’ rooms, then a new ICRA is not needed as long as the scope of the work is the same (i.e., painting only in a resident’s room). Make sure that the details of the ICRA are updated to reflect the project (i.e., the date, the area where the project will take place, etc.). However, a new ICRA must be created if the scope of work (e.g., painting + sanding) or the preventive measures changes (e.g., the painting will take place in the medication room, near medications).
