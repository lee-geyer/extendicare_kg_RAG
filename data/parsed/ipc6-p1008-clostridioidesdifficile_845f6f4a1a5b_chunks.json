If transport is more than two hours, the sample must be refrigerated. - Stool sample must be a liquid or loose stool, which takes the shape of the container. The container must be 1/3 full (25ml) without preservatives. - Formed stool is not an appropriate specimen and should not be sent for testing. - Repeat testing during the same episode of diarrhea or follow-up for ‘test of cure’ is not usually indicated.",

Note: Depending on the type of laboratory test used, a second test may be indicated if the first test is negative, and symptoms persist. Confirm with the local laboratory authorities, if indicated. - Testing after C. difficile symptoms are resolved is not recommended as toxin may persist in stool for weeks to months despite resolution of illness. - Document assessments and interventions in the interdisciplinary progress notes and the Resident’s plan of care.#### Management and Treatment\nIn consultation with the Physician/NP and pharmacy, review Resident’s current medications.- Consider discontinuing antibiotic therapy if possible. Antibiotics intended for the treatment of C. difficile are exceptions and should be initiated promptly. - Antidiarrheal agents should not be used until C. difficile has been excluded.Transfer of Residents suspected or confirmed to have C.",
