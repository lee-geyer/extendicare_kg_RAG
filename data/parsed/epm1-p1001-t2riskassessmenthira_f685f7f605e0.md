## Risk Assessment (HIRA)

**Date:** Enter date
**Completed by:**

Complete this tool to identify your hazards, determine their probability, consequence, and priority. Once you have completed this, create action plans and emergency plans to mitigate these hazards. Keep this Risk Assessment and the action plans and emergency plans in your home-specific Emergency Response Plan. See pages 4-10 for potential hazards/definitions.

### Probability
In the probability column, rate the likelihood of the identified threat occurring from 1-5.

| Rating | Description                                                                 |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Rare: Once every 10 years                                                  |
| 2      | Unlikely: Occurs every 6-10 years                                          |
| 3      | Moderate: Occurs every 2-5 years                                           |
| 4      | Likely: Occurs once per year                                               |
| 5      | Almost Certain: Occurs more than once per year                             |

### Consequence
In the Consequence column, rate the consequence to the business if the threat were to occur from 1-5.

| Rating | Description                                                                 |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Insignificant: No injuries, minor damage to corporate assets, no disruption to delivery of services. |
| 2      | Minor: Minor injuries to staff or visitors that are non-life threatening (cuts and bruises) and that do not require acute medical care; minor damage to corporate assets and/or corporate infrastructure – home can still function and problem can be handled by maintenance staff; minor disruption to service delivery, such as short term power failure, critical operations can function fully, other operations can function with some accommodations. |
| 3      | Moderate: Some serious injuries such as fractures or loss of consciousness that require acute medical care and removal from the workplace; higher number of minor injuries; more widespread damage to assets; longer disruption in service delivery. |
| 4      | Major: Some loss of life; higher number of serious injuries; more serious asset and infrastructure damage that compromises the integrity of a building and that requires an alternate work location for some staff which affects multiple departments. |
| 5      | Catastrophic: Widespread loss of life and serious injuries; serious and widespread damage to corporate property and destruction of infrastructure; financial devastation to the extent that the corporation may never recover – assets destroyed, unrecoverable loss of data, loss of key personnel. |

## Priority

Once the probability and consequence have been determined, the priority is measured as a number as well as high, medium, or low as per the chart below. On the vertical, “likelihood” side of the chart look at the number you selected for likelihood. On the horizontal, “consequence” side of the chart look at the number you selected for consequence and the space they meet at indicates the priority number.

## Potential Hazards/Definitions

### Environmental Threats

#### Tornado
A tornado is defined as a rotating column of air ranging in width from a few yards to more than a mile and whirling at destructively high speeds, usually accompanied by a funnel-shaped downward extension of a cumulonimbus cloud. The consequences of a tornado may include fatalities, severe damage, and loss of essential services. A number of critical infrastructures are at risk during a tornado including buildings, roads, utilities, and rail lines.

#### Severe Electrical Storm (Lightning And Thunderstorms)
Lightning is a large static discharge that develops most commonly within thunderstorms, where convection and gravitational forces combine with an ample supply of particles to generate differential electrostatic charges.

#### Flooding
An overflowing of water beyond its normal confines, especially over land. Flooding may occur as a result of heavy rainfall and, in spring, as a result of a sudden melting of ice and snow.

# Risk Assessment (HIRA)

## Environmental Threats

### Hail/Freezing
A form of precipitation that originates in convective clouds in the form of balls or irregular pieces of ice which come in different shapes and sizes. Hail is considered to have a diameter of 5 millimetres or more; smaller bits of ice are classified as ice pellets, snow pellets or graupel. Individual lumps are called hailstones.

### Winter Storm
Violent snowstorms are typically called blizzards. Blizzards are generally defined by a period of six or more hours with winds above 40 km/h, with visibility reduced to below 1 km by blowing and drifting snow.

### Freezing Conditions
Extreme cold is characterized by temperatures falling to -30°C or less. Severe freezing conditions may overwhelm the ability of a HVAC system to maintain a comfortable indoor environment.

### Site Contamination (Infestation, Food, Water, Chemicals)
Contaminations of a site due to infestation of vermin and/or chemicals can pose a serious health risk. As such this type of hazard could create a home-wide shutdown of operations.

### Epidemic/Pandemic/Group Illness
A widespread and/or severe epidemic, incident of contamination or other situation that presents a danger to, or otherwise negatively impacts, the general health and well-being of the human population.

- **Group Illness**: An illness that spreads through a group of people within a single home or group of people but does not cause a major impact on the greater community.
- **Epidemic**: Major incidents of human illness caused by the transmission of a specific disease. In a community or region, the occurrence of cases of an illness (or an outbreak) with a frequency clearly in excess of normal expectancy.
- **Pandemic**: An epidemic of major proportion involving multiple countries.

### Tsunami
A very large oceanic wave or series of waves caused by earthquakes, underwater landslides, volcanic eruptions, or other major water disturbance. Tsunamis have impacted both the east and west coasts of Canada.

### Earthquake
An earthquake is a sudden shaking or trembling of the surface of the earth. Earthquakes are caused by the release of built up stress in the earth’s surface along fault lines or by the movement of magma in volcanic areas.

# Risk Assessment (HIRA)

## Environmental Threats

| Threat        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Landslide     | A landslide is a term that describes a wide range of ground movement including rock slides, deep failure of slopes and shallow debris flows. Landslides often occur due to gravitational pull on unstable slopes. |
| Hurricane     | A violent cyclonic storm producing extremely powerful winds with speeds in excess of 120 KM/hour (32 m/sec) and torrential rains. Hurricanes are also capable of producing high waves and damaging storm surges that may spawn tornadoes. Hurricanes develop over warm water and lose their strength as they move inland. Coastal areas will receive significant damage from a hurricane while inland regions may only receive heavy rains, mass flooding and storm surges. |
| Avalanche     | An avalanche is a rapid flow of snow down a slope that may be triggered by environmental or human activity. Typically occurs in mountainous terrain. Avalanches have the potential to carry large amounts of snow, ice, water, air, rocks and sediment over large distances. Avalanches occur because of stress of the snow pack. They are not random or spontaneous events. |
| Wild Fires    | A wild fire is an uncontrolled fire that occurs in a countryside or wilderness area. A wild fire differs from other fires because of its size and the speed at which it can spread from its original source. Wild fires have the ability to change direction unexpectedly and to jump gaps such as roads, rivers, and fire breaks. |
| Severe Heat   | Severe heat is a term describing days of excessive temperatures (40°C+) which may be accompanied by high humidity and may make it very difficult to work or perform daily functions. This level of heat may overwhelm the ability of HVAC systems to maintain a comfortable indoor environment. |

## Human Threats

| Threat                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Workplace Violence     | Workplace violence can range from a basic disagreement that involves threats of violence or minor physical contact, up to and including an unprovoked attack that seriously injures or kills an employee or resident. At the extreme range, workplace violence can have a wide ranging effect on the operation of a home and the personal and mental health of the staff. |
| Neighbourhood Violence | Any type of violence can cause harm or abuse to an individual in the community. The primary concern is when the neighbourhood violence has a potential to affect persons at the home (e.g. person flees onto the home property). Higher risks may arise in such situations. |

# Risk Assessment (HIRA)

## Human Threats

### Shootings/Stabbings, Etc.
- Include close proximity to high schools, colleges, universities, or night clubs.

### Sabotage
Sabotage is an act of malicious damage that focuses on disabling, destroying, or injuring the intended target. The consequences of such events are substantial and include widespread injuries/damages and the loss of basic services.

### Theft/Robbery
Robbery is actually defined as theft with violence. Theft itself is defined as stealing; larceny.

### Arson
Arson is defined as the fraudulent burning of property. It is a deliberate act of violence in which fire is the tool for assault. Arson is meant to destroy the intended target.

### Community Disruptions (Protests, Riots, Etc.)
A public demonstration or gathering that results in a disruption of essential functions through rioting, looting, arson, or other unlawful behavior. Protests or parades may disrupt roadways, blocking access to the home and delaying staff arrival or the delivery of supplies. Consequences of a civil disorder, including injuries and minor and localized damage, must be noted.

### Labour Disruption
Labour disruptions are often the result of organized, legal job action and can affect internal staff as well as external contract staff or deliveries. Staff shortages may lead to reduced care for residents, reduced capacity to conduct regular operations, and loss to some areas or services may occur.

## Utilities And Services Threats

### Extreme Power Failure
Although an external power failure is a possibility, this type of event is more of a workplace disruption in relation to continuing with the daily operation of a home that does not have back-up power. An energy emergency occurring during the winter months can be more severe and could result in a number of consequences including fatalities, severe damage, and the loss of essential services.

### Loss Of Natural Gas
This is an event in which the natural gas supply is somehow disrupted and/or cut off to the home. Depending on the time of the year and the home’s dependence on natural gas, this type of occurrence could create a disruption of services.

## Utilities And Services Threats

| Threat                     | Description                                                                                       |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Gas Line Rupture**      | An event that poses a threat to public safety from the uncontrolled release of oil and/or natural gas from:
- a pipeline;
- natural gas meter;
- storage facilities and/or distribution systems. |
| **Loss Of Water**         | The consequences that result from a water disruption are serious and include a loss of drinking water, impact on food preparation, inability to flush toilets or provide baths. A serious impact to health could be expected if the water emergency involves contamination. |
| **Fuel Shortage**         | Fuel shortages can be short lived or long term. It is the length of the shortage that has a direct relation to the consequences to Extendicare. If an organization is dependent on fuel for its vehicular fleet then this type of shortage could create a total shutdown of operations. |
| **Communications Service Breakdown** | Communications breakdown can range from a loss of internet communications to the loss of telephones. If online resident care documentation is routinely used, the home should be prepared to utilize paper forms. |
| **Sewage/Drainage/Waste Removal** | A failure of this type can pose more of a health threat to the staff/residents than a concern for the home. However, sewage and waste backup can create widespread property damage thus creating a serious disruption in business activities. |
| **Air Conditioning Failure** | This type of failure within a home can create an untenable environment for the staff/residents, which could result in health concerns relating to high internal building temperatures. |
| **Heating System Failure** | This type of failure within a building can create an untenable environment for the staff and residents, which could result in health concerns relating to cold internal temperatures within the building. |

# Risk Assessment (HIRA)

## Infrastructure Threats

### Building Collapse/Instability
Building collapse can have a catastrophic effect on the staff, residents, and the home structure itself. The level of damage and consequence is directly related to the level of collapse and/or instability of the structure. As such, the home and its staff could experience a minor delay in operations with no injuries to the staff, up to and including total failure of the structure with possible loss of life.

### On-Site Fire
The consequences involved with this type of situation are high, resulting in the possibility of severe damage to the facility and the loss of essential services.

### Hazardous Materials/Spills/Releases
These types of events are quite difficult to control and impossible to contain since the chemicals tend to follow the direction of the wind. The consequences from such an emergency can be substantial and can include widespread injuries/damage and the loss of essential services. There is also a great risk for negative environmental impact as well as damage to critical infrastructures.

## Information Technology Threats

### Loss Of Fire/Security Systems
The loss of a home’s fire and security systems is a major concern relating to the health and safety of a home and its occupants. Without an early warning system, the loss to life and property can be high and a shutdown of operations could occur.

### Loss Of Communication
The loss of communication at a home is a major concern to the health and safety of the home and its occupants as well as the flow of operations.

### Loss Of Computer Systems
Loss of computer systems due to a virus or cyber attack is becoming a major concern that can impact the home's ability to access care plans, medication administration records, and administrative information. Cyber attacks may include intentional hacking of the system network to obtain or modify sensitive information or may lead to loss of access to critical information, altered function of some systems and medical devices, and damaged reputation in the event of leaked health information.

## Other Risks

### Tenant Issues (In Shared Facilities)
Tenant issues can be considered a high-risk concern should the site be affected by any inherent dangerous conditions of another tenant in the same building. These concerns can go beyond simple annoyance.

- **Hazardous Packages**: Packages that contain hazardous materials including explosive, flammable, combustible, toxic, or radioactive materials.

### Neighbourhood Risk
- Neighbourhood risks can encompass a wide variety of situations which range from production of hazardous items to high risk operations at buildings within close proximity to the home.

### Transportation Corridor
- Being within 1.6 km of a high speed highway (80km/h or higher), rail line or seaway where dangerous goods may be transported.

### External Incident
- An external incident is any event in which resources such as personnel, equipment and space may be overwhelmed by an influx of residents or incoming individuals looking for refuge. This may be triggered by any number of external hazards, including, but not limited to: fires, damage to another LTC and extreme weather.

### Other
- This heading is generic in nature and allows for items not covered by the previously noted threats. The threat list on the Risk Assessment form is meant to be customized for each home based on their determination of the risks/threats facing their location.
