## Policy
### Safe Resident Handling

## Procedure
Staff will adhere to Extendicare’s protocols as outlined, related to the use of lift and transfer devices to mitigate risk of injury, and ensure the safety of all residents.

- Staff supporting with the lift/transfer will conduct a point of care risk assessment prior to initiating any transfer to ensure the residents’ abilities support use of the most appropriate lift or transfer device.
- The Mechanical Lift and Device Safe Operation Log will be completed on all mechanical lifts/devices each shift.
- Slings for use with lifts and all other transfer devices (i.e., gait/transfer belts) will be visually inspected for safe operation prior to each use.
- Slings will not be left under the resident; the interdisciplinary team will review on a case-by-case basis if this practice would benefit the resident, this will be identified in the resident individualized plan of care.
- Any mechanical lift or transfer device with identified defects upon inspection will immediately be tagged/locked out and reported to the nurse and/or manager.
- Mechanical lifts, transfer device(s), and slings/belts will be utilized according to manufacturer’s instructions, including the application of all attachments (i.e., safety belts, straps, and stays).
- At minimum, two trained staff will be present for the full duration of the transfer with use of any mechanical lift, including but not limited to:
- The correct type and size of sling will be verified when preparing the resident; the staff will ensure each loop or clip is fastened to the lift prior to initiating the transfer.
- One staff will operate the lift while the second staff guides by ensuring the pathway is clear, monitors the safety of the resident while the lift is in motion, and communicates and provides reassurance to the resident as applicable.
- Where required, the interdisciplinary team will work with the equipment vendor to procure mechanical lifts with higher weight capacities, specialized slings, or other devices to support individual needs of bariatric residents.
- Any special considerations required to support the safe lift and transfer of bariatric residents, including the potential support of more than 2 staff to perform safe transfers, will be clearly documented in the individualized plan of care.
