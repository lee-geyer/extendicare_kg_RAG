The Criminal Code was amended on June 6th, 2016, under federal Bill C-14 and as such, it is no longer a criminal offence in Canada for select health practitioners (doctors or nurse practitioners) to help someone end their life in certain circumstances. Further amendments to the Criminal Code were brought into force on March 17, 2021.### 1.",

How is medical assistance in dying different from stopping or not starting treatment? Residents may choose to stop treatment or not to start treatment. These decisions, like assisted dying, are each resident’s decisions to make. Residents base these decisions on their values, beliefs, and healthcare goals. The key difference is the intent of the decision. Residents who choose to stop treatment or not to start treatment intend to avoid treatment that will not provide a benefit or that is too difficult. Their intent is not necessarily to bring about their own death.",

Is medical assistance in dying the same as assisted suicide? They are similar. Medical assistance in dying includes both patient-administered and physician-administered methods. In the past, the patient-administered method was called assisted suicide.## 12. Do I have to undergo treatment first? No, you do not have to undergo treatment (e.g., chemotherapy, surgery) you find unacceptable. The Supreme Court wrote that irremediable: “… does not require the patient to undertake treatments that are not acceptable to the individual.”⁴## 13. Is there a right decision? This is a personal decision based on your values, beliefs, and health care goals. You determine what is right or wrong for you.## 14. Does my physician have to agree I meet the criteria?

Can I expect my health care team to provide medical assistance in dying? Maybe. Many healthcare professionals and some healthcare institutions will be unwilling to help with assisted dying because it is not comfortable for them or goes against an institution’s faith-based mission. It is a very personal choice for them, too. If they cannot help, you will be connected to a person or resource that will.## 16. Do I have to inform my family? It is usually a good idea to try to involve your family – getting medical assistance in dying may have a major impact on them. If it is difficult to talk with your family for any reason, you can ask for help from your healthcare team (e.g., social workers, spiritual care providers, occupational therapists, or others).## 17.
