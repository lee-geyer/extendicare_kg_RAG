## POLICY
Extendicare is committed to providing individualized pain management strategies to enhance the quality of life, promote comfort, dignity, and well-being for all residents, through early detection, ongoing assessment, and evaluation in accordance with evidence-based practices and regulatory requirements.

### STANDARD
- The home will designate a regulated healthcare professional as the pain management lead, who will collaborate with the interdisciplinary team to ensure effective pain management strategies and processes according to evidence-based guidelines.
- The nurse will screen residents routinely to identify the presence of pain using standardized and validated evidence-based tools, according to the resident’s ability to communicate their pain experience.
- Where pain is evident upon screening, a comprehensive assessment will be conducted for the development of individualized pain management strategies and care approaches.
- The interdisciplinary team will inform the resident and/or Substitute Decision Maker (SDM) or Power of Attorney (POA) of all viable treatment options, ensuring autonomy and alignment with the goals of care for an integrated approach to pain management reflective of the residents’ values, preferences, and cultural beliefs.
- The plan of care will be developed with the objective of providing optimal pain relief and improving functional capacity, both physical and psychosocial, through implementation of interdisciplinary interventions, inclusive of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.
- Pain monitoring will be completed routinely, and as required according to Extendicare procedure, where strategies will be evaluated for effectiveness and documented in the resident health record.

Timely reporting to the nurse and timely assessment and reassessment will be conducted to support changes in health status and ensure appropriate revisions to the plan of care.
