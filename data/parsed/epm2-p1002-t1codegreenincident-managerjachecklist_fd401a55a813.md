*Note: You may edit this job action checklist to be home-specific.*

### Respond

_____

**Determine the stage of the “Code Green”, stage 1, 2 or 3:**

In fire emergencies, the initial response is a partial evacuation of people from the area of the fire/smoke to an area beyond the fire doors/fire separation (Refer to Fire Safety Plan). In some homes, a two-stage bell alarm is in place. The first alarm means that a partial evacuation is required; if the second series of bells alarm, a full evacuation is required.

- Partial horizontal evacuation, moving from one area of the floor to another area of the same floor behind fire barrier doors.

- **Stage 2, Wing or Floor:**
- Partial evacuation of a larger area, such as an entire unit or multiple units. This could continue to be a horizontal evacuation or a vertical evacuation, moving from one floor towards the ground floor (do not use elevators unless authorized by fire department).

- **Stage 3, Total:**
- Full evacuation of the building to an external refuge location.

If the emergency evacuation starts in stage 2 or 3, skip to the area of the checklist that indicates that stage of evacuation.

- Notify the regulatory body/Regional Health Authority and other government reporting authorities (e.g., Ministry of Labour) if required.
- Update the Executive Director/Designate.
- If evacuation is due to fire, assess the fire/smoke spread and determine if a larger area is required to be evacuated. Consideration will be given to evacuation areas immediately adjacent, immediately above, and immediately below the fire.

> **Note:** When there is no immediate danger and time to wait for emergency services to arrive, the decision to evacuate and the extent of the evacuation will be made along with emergency services officials.

## Evacuation Procedures:
1. Designate all staff to either be on the outer side of the fire doors taking received residents, or to go room to room evacuating residents. Where possible, try to have the same number of people receiving residents at the fire door as teams evacuating residents from rooms (for example, you have 9 staff members, 3 will receive residents at the fire doors and 6 will be broken into teams to evacuate rooms).
2. Organize all staff who are going room to room into teams of two.
3. Teams enter rooms and bring resident(s) to the closest fire doors.
4. Staff waiting on the other side of fire doors take the residents to safety.
5. After a team has confirmed there are no residents in a room, they close the door and flag the room as empty.
6. Steps 1-3 continue until all the residents in the affected area have been evacuated.
