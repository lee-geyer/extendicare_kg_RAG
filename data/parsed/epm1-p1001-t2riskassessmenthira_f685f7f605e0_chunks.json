A number of critical infrastructures are at risk during a tornado including buildings, roads, utilities, and rail lines.#### Severe Electrical Storm (Lightning And Thunderstorms)\nLightning is a large static discharge that develops most commonly within thunderstorms, where convection and gravitational forces combine with an ample supply of particles to generate differential electrostatic charges.#### Flooding\nAn overflowing of water beyond its normal confines, especially over land.",

Typically occurs in mountainous terrain. Avalanches have the potential to carry large amounts of snow, ice, water, air, rocks and sediment over large distances. Avalanches occur because of stress of the snow pack. They are not random or spontaneous events. |\n| Wild Fires    | A wild fire is an uncontrolled fire that occurs in a countryside or wilderness area. A wild fire differs from other fires because of its size and the speed at which it can spread from its original source. Wild fires have the ability to change direction unexpectedly and to jump gaps such as roads, rivers, and fire breaks. |\n| Severe Heat   | Severe heat is a term describing days of excessive temperatures (40°C+) which may be accompanied by high humidity and may make it very difficult to work or perform daily functions.",
