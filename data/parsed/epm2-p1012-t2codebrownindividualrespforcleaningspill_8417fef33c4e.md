### Respond

Record the time action was initiated (note on the line below):

Upon hearing the Code Brown alert, proceed to the spill location to assess the situation.

- The individual responsible for cleaning the spill may be the Incident Manager unless a more senior staff member is present.
- Use the Code Brown Incident Manager Job Action Checklist to determine if the spill is manageable or unmanageable.

#### Manageable Spills - Clean Up Procedures

- Initiate clean-up following the assessment of the spill and your team's capacity.
- Clean up the spill only if:
- You have the correct spill kit, resources, and PPE to clean the material.
- You fully understand the procedures to clean the material.
- The spill is a known material and of a manageable size to clean (under 1 liter).
- The spill is not flammable.

> **Note:** If the spill is outside the capability of your team, follow the steps outlined below in Unmanageable Spill Procedures.

- If possible, stop the source of the leak or spill.
- Consult the Safety Data Sheets (SDS) to understand the appropriate cleaning procedures and PPE required.
- Obtain the spill response kit. This kit will include absorbent materials and other equipment to disperse, collect, and contain spill control materials (e.g., brushes, scoops, sealable containers).
- Protect all floor drains or other means of environmental release.
- Distribute loose spill control materials over the entire spill area, working from the outside, circling to the inside, reducing the chance of splash, or spread of the spilled material.
