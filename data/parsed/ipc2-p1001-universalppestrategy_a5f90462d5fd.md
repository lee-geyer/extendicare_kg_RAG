## POLICY

### Infection Prevention

### PROCEDURE

Pending specific notification, the policy will be considered “in effect” or “not in effect”. Homes will implement a universal PPE strategy to protect residents and staff that requires extended and/or particular use of PPE including a mask and/or eye protection to control and decrease the risk of spreading infection in accordance with public health authority directives as they become available, or at the direction of Extendicare Senior Leadership Team.

The success of this strategy will require the following:

- Meticulous adherence to proper hand hygiene;
- Proper mask use and hygiene including wearing the mask as directed (must cover the mouth and the nose);
- Strict avoidance of manipulation/touching the mask to reduce the risk of contamination and self-inoculation.
- Implement the procedure, upon notification from Chief Medical Officer, Chief Nursing Executive and/or IPAC Manager.
- Implement and follow the procedure upon notification of an “in effect” status.
- Ensure the core supply of PPE.
- Ensure that there is a sufficient supply and access to PPE in each home area, including all appropriate sizes of fit-tested N95 or equivalent respirators, on all shifts. Monitor the core supply and order additional supplies when needed.
- Follow and direct staff on province-specific guidance or Extendicare SLT guidance as it becomes available pertaining to the use of specific PPE (i.e., extended, or continuous mask wearing).
- Establish a process for cleaning, disinfecting, and reusing face shields, goggles and/or safety glasses, if required. Disposable PPE is recommended.
- Ensure staff strongly encourage symptomatic residents to wear/be assisted to wear a mask, as tolerated, when receiving direct care, when in common areas with other residents (e.g., wandering), and when receiving a visitor.
- Consult, when possible, with DOC/designate prior to providing direction to care staff or providing care directly to a resident, for relevant updates on resident situation/status, outbreak status, and PPE supply, as required, when making decisions on PPE usage.
- Follow policy, Aerosol-Generating Medical Procedures (AGMP) when an AGMP is in progress in a resident room, as required, including procedures pertaining to appropriate PPE (N95 respirator) use/requirements.
- Ensure a procedural/surgical mask is worn at all times while in the home as directed.
