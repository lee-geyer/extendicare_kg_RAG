# Outbreaks in Long-Term Care Homes

Outbreaks are common in long-term care (LTC) homes because residents sharing air, space, food, and equipment are also sharing organisms that can easily cause infectious outbreaks. LTC residents are also more prone and vulnerable to infections, which can lead to death. From time to time, shared infectious agents – usually bacteria or viruses – cause infectious outbreaks. In LTC homes, the opportunities for infectious outbreaks are abundant, and the consequences can be severe: all outbreaks – even of pathogens as common as noroviruses – can result in the death of residents; so it is important to understand how to prevent, prepare for, detect, and manage them.

> “Early detection (2 or more Residents exhibiting respiratory or gastro symptoms that are new or unusual for the Residents) together with the timely implementation of outbreak control measures that are carefully adhered to, can effectively minimize transmission of infection, thereby preventing or more quickly bringing an outbreak under control.”
> A Guide to the Control of Respiratory Infection Outbreaks in Long-Term Care Homes, Ministry of Health and Long Term Care 2018

## Outbreak Monitoring

Outbreak monitoring should include:

- Ongoing surveillance to identify new cases, based on Case Definitions
- Monitoring the status of ill residents and staff
- Updating line listings/HealthConnex
- Continuous use of the 24-hr Symptom Surveillance form and HealthConnex
- Ongoing monitoring of precautions and control measures
- Reporting any significant changes in the nature of the outbreak (e.g., hospitalizations, deaths, changes in clinical picture), as per provincial directives
```

# Preparation for Outbreak Season

Outbreaks can occur at any time throughout the year, but they occur more frequently throughout the winter months. Annually, ideally before outbreak season, all homes should complete the Preparation for Outbreak Season Checklist.

**Download the PREPARATION FOR OUTBREAK SEASON CHECKLIST** by clicking the Word document download icon.

## The Preparation for Outbreak Season Checklist includes the following actions:

1. Review laboratory procedures and ensure appropriate laboratory supplies are available (and not expired) in sufficient quantities (order Nasopharyngeal swabs from PH lab if needed). Ensure access to test kits (respiratory/enteric).
2. Ensure written or verbal consents are obtained (influenza immunization/antiviral prophylactic medications) from all residents (consult with Pharmacy/Pharmacist to ensure Tami Flu in ESB [Emergency Supply Box] is not expired).
3. Ensure creatinine data is current for each resident (review that labs are up to date with Pharmacist, consult with MD/NP for bloodwork orders for any outstanding).
4. Obtain and document current weights for each resident.
5. Review and complete monthly new admission audits to ensure relevant data has been obtained (consent, creatinine levels, and weight if required for antiviral calculations).
6. Outline strategies for immunization campaign including:
- Presenting the importance of immunization to Family and Resident council.
- Communicating to POA upcoming immunization campaigns.
- Updating staff immunization lists for immunization.
- Contacting Public Guardian & Trustee for all required residents.
- Faxing consent forms, as required.

Proceed with planning as follows:
a. Determine times and places for immunization clinics (include day and evening clinics).
b. Distribute Public Health or Extendicare-developed resources and information about the vaccine and benefits of immunization by posting these throughout the home in high traffic areas i.e., elevators, entrances, and in home areas.
c. Organize education day for staff (pending resource availability from Public Health).
d. Distribute Staff Influenza Intention forms to all staff and update staff immunization lists, as applicable.
```

```markdown
# Outbreak Management Procedures

## 1. Immunization Consent
- Update resident immunization consent in PCC under the resident immunization tab.

## 2. Staffing Contingency Plan
- Ensure a staffing contingency plan is in place (e.g., non-immunized staff, Tamiflu®, not able to come to work, limited to work in certain areas, etc.).

## 3. Material and Supplies Inventory
7. Assemble, audit, and inventory other material and supplies (e.g., personal protective equipment, cleaning and hand hygiene supplies) required for outbreak management and ensure procedures are in place for rapidly obtaining additional supplies in sufficient quantities when an outbreak occurs.
- Order additional supplies and/or PPE if required.

## 4. N95 Respirator Fit-Testing
8. Ensure all staff are up-to-date with N95 respirator fit-testing (refer to the PPE Guide for more information).

## 5. Key Contacts List
9. Create or update a list of key people and their contact information for notification purposes in the event of an outbreak in the home. This may include members of the outbreak team, as well as a list of individuals or agencies that may be contacted for supplies or services.

## 6. Best Practices in Surveillance and IPAC
10. Implement best practice in surveillance and IPAC for infectious illness consisting of the following:
- a. Immunization – where available/applicable
- b. Case Finding/Surveillance
- c. Preventive Practices
- d. Reporting
- e. Evaluation

# Overseeing an Outbreak

The Infection Control Professional (ICP)/Designate manages and oversees the home’s outbreaks by leading the planning, development, implementation, coordination, and evaluation of IPAC processes before, during, and after any outbreak, including but not limited to the following:

## Before an Outbreak
- Complete the “Preparation for Outbreak Season Checklist” in August/September
- Review and analyze the Daily 24-hour Symptom Surveillance forms/HealthConnex to determine if there is a potential for an outbreak
- Initiate a line list/suspect outbreak in HealthConnex (resident and staff) to begin tracking resident symptoms
- Inform the local health authority of the suspected outbreak immediately
- Establish the case definition

## During an Outbreak
- Chair Outbreak Management Team Meetings
- Implement and monitor all procedures to contain/control the outbreak
- Liaise with local health authority daily
- Maintain the resident and staff line lists
- Ensure PPE and Hand Hygiene audits are completed, analyzed, and education is provided as needed
- Ongoing evaluation of control measures
- Maintain all data collected regarding the outbreak in one location

## After an Outbreak
- Schedule Final Outbreak Meeting to discuss gaps and successes
- Follow up to correct gaps identified
- Update Home Specific Outbreak Plan
```

```markdown
# Outbreak Process Algorithm

## Surveillance identifies a cluster of similar symptoms (suspect outbreak)

### Contact health authority to discuss surveillance data and determine the presence of an outbreak

#### IS THERE AN OUTBREAK?

- **MAYBE**
- Increase Surveillance
- **NO**
- End
- **YES**
- Establish case definition
- Intervention

### Data Collection

1. Continue using 24-Hr Symptom Surveillance form/HealthConnex to identify additional cases - refer to case definition
2. Identify high-risk contacts (COVID-19)
3. Conduct environmental audits (i.e., high touch cleaning)
4. Increase hand hygiene and PPE audits
5. Confirm with lab diagnosis

### Post-Outbreak

1. Complete outbreak analysis
2. Identify source and transmission, including epi links
3. Identify and address gaps with an action plan.
```

# Cold Chain

It is important to understand and meet vaccine storage and handling requirements to maintain the “cold chain”. The “cold chain” includes all of the materials, equipment, and procedures used to maintain vaccines in the required temperature range of +2 ºC to +8 ºC from the time of manufacture until the vaccines are administered to individuals. Complete the Cold Chain Checklist in July to ensure the cold chain is maintained.

Download the COLD CHAIN CHECKLIST by clicking the Word document download icon.

## Cold Chain Checklist

The Cold Chain Checklist is a checklist for safeguarding the storage and handling of your vaccine supply and includes the following items:

- We have a designated person in charge of ordering vaccines, inventory management, and refrigerator monitoring.
- Our staff have been provided with training about the importance of good vaccine management.
- All our vaccines are unpacked, maintained in their original packaging, and refrigerated IMMEDIATELY upon delivery.
- If there is a break in the cold chain, any exposed vaccines are labeled as “DO NOT USE” in the refrigerator.
- We contact the health authority to report cold chain incidents and determine if vaccines are usable.
- We use a dedicated, purpose-built (commercial) vaccine refrigerator (also referred to as pharmacy, lab-style, or laboratory grade refrigerator), or a domestic frost-free fridge to store vaccines.
- We DO NOT store anything other than vaccines (i.e., food, beverages, other medications, etc.) in the refrigerator.
- Our vaccines are rotated on the “FIRST TO EXPIRE, FIRST OUT” principle.
- Our vaccines are checked for EXPIRY dates at the beginning or end of every month.

- Sealed water bottles or flexible insulating blankets are stored (if space allows) on the upper and lower shelves and in the door of the refrigerator. Ice packs are stored in the freezer.
- A **“DO NOT UNPLUG”** sign has been placed next to our refrigerator’s electrical outlet.
- A hard-sided or soft-sided insulated cooler with a tight-fitting lid along with ice packs and insulating material is always used in transporting vaccines for short periods of time and at clinic workstations.
- An **EMERGENCY PLAN** for power outages and refrigerator malfunctions has been established.

## Refrigeration

1. The refrigeration unit designated as a vaccine fridge must **ONLY** be used for vaccines.
2. Stock no more than a **one-month supply**.
3. Organize vaccines by product.
4. Allow space between the vaccine packages in the refrigerator for air flow.
5. Protect all vaccines from light exposure.
6. Do not store vaccine on door shelves.
7. Ensure that the vaccine refrigerator is plugged into an emergency outlet connected to a generator, where possible.

## Recording Temperatures

1. Ensure internal refrigeration temperatures are taken and recorded **2 times daily**.
2. Maintain recorded temperatures with dates and times for at least **6 months**.

# Surveillance

## Definitions of Infections in Canadian LTC Facilities

The use of Case definitions is vital to define a set of uniform criteria used to define a disease for surveillance. Case definitions enable homes and health authorities to count cases in a consistent manner.

Every health authority will follow their provincial reporting guidelines for respiratory and enteric outbreaks. Be familiar with the reporting requirements for your home.

Once symptoms have been identified as a case defined in the **Surveillance Definitions of Infections in Canadian LTC Facilities**, further monitoring is required to identify similar or subsequent instances of the defined case. Simply, the case definition will be derived based on the symptoms that are presenting.

Once a trend has been identified, the following Case Definitions examples may be used to report to the health authority/unit:

- **Enteric**: Two or more episodes of vomiting and/or diarrhea that is new/unusual for a resident or staff member on unit ____________ after Date_________. Fever may or may not be present.

- **Respiratory**: Onset of acute respiratory illness with symptoms of malaise, cough, and congestion (fever may or may not be present) that is new or unusual for a resident or staff member on unit ___________ after Date__________.

Once a case definition has been established, a line list will be initiated for both staff and residents.
```

```markdown
# Line Listing for Outbreak Investigation

A line list helps organize information during an outbreak investigation. The data points will help determine if the individual meets the case definition, and how many people may be involved in the outbreak.

## Initiating a Line Listing

- Initiate a line listing to begin tracking residents with the date and time of onset of symptoms.
- Initiate a separate line listing to identify staff with similar symptoms.

A line list’s information describes an outbreak in terms of person, place, and time. A well-constructed line list will summarize the known information, allowing for quick identification of trends, missing information, and errors. This will facilitate the creation of descriptive statistics for your outbreak review once the outbreak is declared over.

## Responsibilities

**ICP/Designate must update and submit the line list daily:**

### BE ROUTINE:
1. Have guidelines that are consistent as to when to start the line list and who is responsible.

### BE SPECIFIC:
1. The outbreak investigation number must be recorded on the line list.
2. Ensure the case definition is clearly listed on the line list and all staff understand the case definition.
3. Cases are added to the line list ONLY when they exhibit symptoms and meet the case definition.
4. Fill out all the areas of the list. This tool will assist in identifying patterns and epidemiological links in the outbreak.

### BE PREPARED:
1. Ensure a copy of the updated line list is available to all staff.
2. Ensure staff are educated on how and when to complete a line list.
3. If you start a list and no outbreak occurs, you can disregard; this is easier than trying to go back and remember dates and details.

Homes are to use the line list provided by their health authority if requested. Ensure that during an outbreak you use two separate line lists: one for residents and one for staff.

```markdown
# Outbreak

Homes must review all signs and symptoms throughout the home on every shift using the 24-hour symptom surveillance form or HealthConnex. The ICP/Designate must be aware of case definitions and contact their health authority when symptoms meet the criteria of a potential outbreak. Place symptomatic residents on Additional Precautions during the period of communicability.

## Isolation

- Where possible, symptomatic individuals should be isolated in a single room.
- Place Additional Precautions signage on the room door indicating the precautions required.
- Residents on isolation should remain in their rooms unless medically necessary (i.e., attending essential diagnostic tests and/or therapeutic interventions).
- Ensure residents on droplet precautions wear a mask (if tolerated) when outside their room and ensure these residents perform hand hygiene.
- Post Extendicare’s appropriate precaution signage outside the affected room to alert anyone entering about required precautions and necessary personal protective equipment (PPE).

## Specimen Collection

- Specimens must be collected from symptomatic residents as per health authority direction.
- All specimen containers and requisitions must include the resident’s name and date of birth, location, and the date and time the specimen was collected.
- Ensure supplies have not expired.
```

```markdown
# Respiratory Outbreak

## CONTACT AND DROPLET PRECAUTIONS ARE USED IN ADDITION TO ROUTINE PRACTICES FOR RESIDENTS WITH SYMPTOMS OF RESPIRATORY ILLNESS

### Droplet Precautions

A surgical/procedure mask must be worn if working within two meters of the resident, or an N95 respirator if on enhanced droplet and contact precautions. The following guidelines must be followed when using a surgical/procedural mask or N95 respirator:

- Must be used only once (masks must be removed carefully by the straps and ties to prevent self-contamination).
- Must be changed if it becomes wet or soiled (from the wearer’s respiration or through an external splash).
- Must cover both the nose and the mouth.
- Must be discarded immediately after use into an appropriate (preferably hands-free) waste receptacle in the isolation room.
- Must never dangle around the neck or under the chin.
- Hand hygiene must be performed as indicated during the donning and doffing sequence and after leaving the resident’s room (refer to the Hand Hygiene Guide).
- Avoid touching the mask as much as possible.

When performing an AGMP (aerosol-generating medical procedure) on a symptomatic resident, use an N95 respirator (fit-tested and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) certified), and:

- Limit the number of staff in the room where AGMPs are performed.
- Reduce, to the greatest extent possible, the use of AGMPs (e.g., nebulizer therapy, open airway suctioning, etc.).
- Perform AGMPs in a single room whenever possible.
- Ensure all individuals present (in the room) wear an N95 respirator.
- Adhere to the ‘settling’ time (if applicable).

Protective eyewear is required when providing direct care within two meters of the resident. Remove personal protective equipment inside the isolation room and dispose of it in a hands-free waste receptacle.

Perform a Point of Care Risk Assessment to determine the necessity of using higher level protection.

*See below for contact precautions.*
```

```markdown
# Enteric Outbreak

## Contact Precautions

Contact precautions are used in addition to routine practices for residents with symptoms of enteric illness.

### Point of Care Risk Assessment (PCRA)

Perform a Point of Care Risk Assessment (PCRA) to determine the necessary level of protection/precautions. The following guidelines must be followed to ensure contact precautions are met:

- Dedicate resident care equipment where possible. Shared equipment must be cleaned and disinfected after each use.
- Provide resident with a private room (where available), door can remain open.
- Gloves should be used at all times when in the resident room and while providing care. Staff must adhere to the 4 moments of hand hygiene.
- Gowns should be donned before entering and doffed immediately before leaving the resident room.
- Perform hand hygiene after doffing gown and gloves and before leaving the room.

### Additional Droplet Precautions

The following droplet precautions must be added when the resident has projectile vomiting or explosive diarrhea:

- A surgical/procedure mask covering the worker’s nose and mouth and protective eyewear if working within two meters of the resident.
- Facial protection should be removed before leaving the resident’s room and disposed of in a hands-free waste receptacle.

## Hand Hygiene

Some enteric infections form spores that cannot be killed by alcohol hand sanitizers (e.g., C. difficile). Ensure a strong emphasis on hand washing versus hand rub.
```

```markdown
# Outbreak Notifications

## NOTIFY APPROPRIATE INDIVIDUALS/AGENCIES

In addition to the health authority, notify the following as appropriate, both internally and externally.

### Internally:
- Email: outbreaks@extendicare.com
- Regional Director
- IPAC Consultant
- Worker member on the Joint Occupational Health and Safety Committee

### Externally (if applicable):
- Health Authority
- Ministry of Labour, when required
- Prepare information updates for staff and families (memo or newsletter)
- Admitting and Emergency departments
- Staffing agencies
- Emergency Medical Services – ambulance
- Coroner’s office for unexpected death(s)
- Pharmacist/Advising Pharmacy
- Community partners
- Third party service providers

Be familiar with reporting requirements for your home, for both internal and external stakeholders.
```

# Outbreak Management

Early detection of a cluster of new signs and symptoms and swift actions in response are essential for effective management of outbreaks. Most outbreaks in long-term care are caused by seasonal respiratory viruses or seasonal norovirus and, when symptoms are identified early and appropriate control measures are implemented, these outbreaks are generally controlled quickly. All staff, students, and volunteers have a role in outbreak prevention and management — a coordinated team approach is essential when managing outbreaks.

Note that your health authority may provide direction during outbreaks once they have been notified. As a guide on how to manage an outbreak, please refer to the **Outbreak Management Cheatsheet** that includes the steps noted below.

**Download the OUTBREAK MANAGEMENT CHEATSHEET by clicking the Word document download icon.**

## Steps for Outbreak Management

1. When a possible outbreak is identified, notify health authority immediately. Provide the home’s primary contact information and a designate’s contact information, should the primary contact be unavailable. Include after hours and weekend contact information as well.
2. Provide notification of a confirmed or suspected outbreak to health authority, Ministry of Labour (if staff affected), Regional Director, IPAC Consultant, and the Administrator.
3. Place potentially infected residents on additional precautions, placing appropriate signage and PPE outside of the rooms.
4. Initiate line listing(s)/outbreak in HealthConnex.
5. Derive a case definition with public health authority/unit (if applicable). The case definition must be communicated to all home areas to ensure accurate reporting of symptoms.
6. Post outbreak signage at the entrance to the home and all resident home areas affected.
7. Arrange an Outbreak Management Team (OMT) Meeting and complete the “Initial Outbreak Minutes”. All OMT representatives should attend the outbreak team meetings.
8. Keep all team members updated on the infection activity in the home (i.e., IPAC huddle, etc.).
9. Review the data collected.
10. Update the case definition as other symptoms appear and communicate to all staff, as needed.
11. Determine the cut-off time for new cases to be added to the line listing.
12. Schedule outbreak meetings with a representative from all departments in attendance at the same time daily.
13. Refer to the Outbreak Management policies in the IPAC Manual.

**PAGE 19**

```markdown
# Outbreak Management Team (OMT)

The Outbreak Management Team (OMT) is a designated team comprised of a home’s managers with representation from all departments and may include community partners/external stakeholders. During an outbreak, the team will meet daily to analyze and implement procedures and protocols to prevent the spread of the infection. The OMT identifies, declares, and provides direction when an outbreak occurs, outlines an action response to the infection and the outbreak, and provides analysis that focuses on the successes or areas of improvement.

## Role of the OMT

The role of the OMT is to:

- Ensure communication with family, staff, and community is timely and accurate
- Ensure that routine practices and additional precautions are in place, are understood, and adhered to
- Develop strategies to handle home-specific situational issues or concerns that may arise during an outbreak
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the actions taken
- Identify needs and communicate this to the regional director, IPAC consultant, and other internal stakeholders
- Submit a final report to the home’s IPAC Committee once the outbreak is deemed over
- Ensure that health authority has received the required reports (initial and final), line lists, etc. of the outbreak

## During Weekends and Holidays

During weekends and holidays, the ICP/designate must designate a registered staff member to oversee outbreak status, communicate with public health, maintain line lists, and continue with daily outbreak meetings.

## Action Items of the OMT

- Initiate a line listing to begin tracking residents with the date and time of onset of symptoms. Initiate a separate line listing to identify staff with similar symptoms.
- Post appropriate signage at the Entrance to the home and all units/home areas affected.
- Arrange an Outbreak Team Meeting and complete the “initial outbreak form”.
- Update all team members of the infection activity in the home.
- Once an outbreak has been confirmed, notify the Regional Director, IPAC Consultant, Corporate office staff (such as LTC Consultant, Dietary Consultant, Environmental Consultant, and/or Infection Control Practitioner, as identified within your region) and the Ministry of Health and/or Ministry of Labour, where required.
- Derive a case definition if not defined by your health authority.
- Communicate the case definition to all nursing staff to ensure accurate reporting of symptoms.
- Update the case definition as other symptoms appear and communicate to all staff.
- Determine the cut-off time for new cases to be added to the line listing.
- Communication of IPAC measures with staff in all departments using the IPAC Huddle form.
```

```markdown
# OMT: Outbreak Documentation

Forms developed by Extendicare provide a framework for documenting the complete outbreak. Documentation relating to the outbreak should be correctly managed and disseminated.

Use the Extendicare Outbreak Meeting Minutes templates to document the OMT’s meetings from the onset of the outbreak to its conclusion and then, ensure the Outbreak tracker/HealthConnex is updated with details of the outbreak daily:

## Access the INITIAL MEETING MINUTES
by clicking the Word document download icon.

1. Completed at the first outbreak meeting

## Access the DAILY MEETING MINUTES
by clicking the Word document download icon.

2. Completed each day while the outbreak is ongoing

## Access the FINAL MEETING MINUTES
by clicking the Word document download icon.

3. Completed at the last outbreak meeting, once the outbreak has concluded.

Documentation relating to the outbreak should be correctly managed and disseminated to ensure that specific resident PHI is not disclosed and that privacy and confidentiality is maintained.
```

# ADMISSIONS, DISCHARGES AND TRANSFERS OF RESIDENTS DURING A CONFIRMED OUTBREAK

- **Admissions to, or transfers from, an affected home may be restricted.**
- Where an admission or transfer back to an outbreak facility may be required, consultation with the health authority and/or the home’s IPAC Home Lead should occur.

## Communication:
- If a transfer is essential, the receiving facility/home should always be notified prior to a transfer that the individual is coming from a facility/home that is experiencing an outbreak and should also indicate whether the individual is asymptomatic, has, or is recovering from the infection.
- The resident and/or family should be informed of the outbreak and the potential risk of exposure and illness to the resident and should all be in agreement to proceed with the admission.

# MANAGEMENT OF NON-HOME REGIONAL STAFF, EXTERNAL PROFESSIONALS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS

As soon as an outbreak is identified, healthcare professionals (Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, etc.) and other personnel/service providers who are not employees of the home, but regularly provide services or access supplies within the home, should be informed that there is an outbreak in the home.

# MANAGEMENT OF VISITORS DURING OUTBREAKS

Your health authority will make all recommendations/decisions regarding visitors during an outbreak.

----

**PAGE 22**

# Additional Precautions

## Dietary Considerations

Dietary considerations for residents on additional precautions include the following:

### DIETARY MANAGER:
- Hold regular meetings with on-duty staff to provide outbreak updates. On weekends, charge nurse to hold meeting with duty staff to provide outbreak update.

# PPE Donning and Doffing

## WITHOUT UNIVERSAL PPE STRATEGY

### Signage

#### PPE DONNING Sequence

| Step | Action                                   |
|------|------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Perform hand hygiene                     |
| 2    | Put on a gown                            |
| 3    | Put on a mask or N95 Respirator         |
| 4    | Put on eye protection (goggles/face shield) |
| 5    | Put on gloves                            |

> **Note:** Follow Universal PPE Strategy principles when policy is in effect.

PPE must be donned correctly before entering the resident area (e.g., isolation room, unit if cohorting). PPE must remain in place and be worn correctly for the duration of work in potentially contaminated areas. PPE should not be adjusted (e.g., retying gown, adjusting respirator/mask) during resident care.

Refer to IPC2-O10.01 Universal PPE policy if directed by health authority. PPE must be removed slowly and deliberately in a sequence that prevents self-contamination. A step-by-step process should be developed and used during training and resident care.

### PPE DOFFING Sequence

| Step | Action                                   |
|------|------------------------------------------|

# N95 Donning and Doffing

## Signage

### Six steps to removing the N95 respirator

| Step  | Action                                                                                     |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Step 1| Wash your hands thoroughly before putting on respirator                                    |
| Step 2| Use an N95 respirator that has been fit-tested for you:                                   |
| Step 3| Hold the respirator in your hand and place it over your nose, mouth, and chin:            |
| Step 4| First, stretch and position the bottom band under your ears. Then, stretch and position the top band high at the back of your head: |
| Step 5| Press the thin metal wire gently against the bridge of your nose so that the respirator fits snugly on your face: |
| Step 6| Perform a fit check by breathing in and out:                                             |
|       | While breathing out; check for air leakage around your face:                              |

> **Note:** Always read and follow the manufacturer’s directions when using an N95 respirator. It must cover both the nose and mouth to keep you from breathing in aerosols. If it does not have a snug fit, it will not work properly. All staff must be fit-tested every 2 years or more frequently if significant changes such as weight loss/gain or oral surgery occur. Correct fit of the respirator requires contact with smooth skin. It will not work properly for people with beards or facial hair. Even one-day beard growth has been shown to let air leak in. Always use both straps on the respirator to hold it in place to keep air from leaking around it. Refer to the PPE Guide for more information on using N95 Respirators.

### Six steps to removing the N95 respirator

| Step  | Action                                                                                     |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Step 1| Perform hand hygiene:                                                                      |
| Step 2| Grasp the bottom band of the respirator; and gently pull over the top of the head:        |
| Step 3| Grasp the top band of the respirator; and gently pull over the top of the head:           |
| Step 4| Lean slightly forward and remove the respirator from the face handling only the bands and avoiding all contact with the front of the respirator: |
| Step 5| Dispose of the respirator into an appropriate waste container:                            |
| Step 6| Perform hand hygiene:                                                                      |

# Declaring the Outbreak

The OMT will meet to review management of the outbreak – what was handled well and what could be improved in managing future outbreaks and review/analyze the following once the outbreak is declared over:

- Number of ill residents;
- Number of deceased residents during the outbreak;
- Number of hospitalized residents;
- Number of ill staff;
- Number of areas in the home affected;
- Pattern of spread;
- Total number of days in outbreak;
- Effectiveness of control measures;
- Audits of staff compliance with routine practices and additional precautions;
- Residents’ ability to follow control measures;
- Challenges with community visitation; and
- Additional costs associated with the outbreak.

> **To declare an outbreak over, the LTCH must not have had any new cases of infection in either residents or staff, which meet the case definition for the period of time established by the OMT i.e., predetermined decision rules that the OMT has decided to use to declare the outbreak over. Commonly these decision rules are based on the period of communicability + the incubation period, or based on two incubation periods.**

As an example, viral respiratory outbreaks may be declared over if no new cases have occurred in 8 days from the onset of symptoms of the last resident case or 3 days from the last day of work of an ill staff, whichever is longer. This “8-day rule” is based on the period of communicability (5 days) and an incubation period (3 days) for influenza and in general may apply to many other respiratory viruses associated with respiratory infection outbreaks as well.
