People with advanced dementia often don’t understand why the PEG feed has been placed in their stomach and frequently pull it out.## Nutrition in Dementia### Comfort Feeding\nIn comfort feeding, oral food/fluid continues in the appropriate texture. For residents whom oral intake is not recommended due to risk of choking/aspiration, small amounts may be offered for comfort. Residents are offered food at meals, snacks, and as desired. Feeding stops when the resident indicates they are finished or distressed. The goal of care is not weight or fluid maintenance but to make the resident as comfortable as possible. Giving small amounts of food, sips of water, mouth care, or ice chips may be sufficient to lighten hunger and thirst and help to preserve quality of life.### Artificial Hydration (AH)\nArtificial hydration is when liquid is administered through a needle into a vein (IV) or under the skin (hypodermoclysis). Using AH may physically burden the resident by drawing out the dying process to weeks, cause fluid overload, breathing difficulty, and more pain and discomfort.",

Using AH may physically burden the resident by drawing out the dying process to weeks, cause fluid overload, breathing difficulty, and more pain and discomfort. Dehydration is a natural part of the dying process and allows for a more comfortable death over a period of days. Hydration will not make the resident feel better or stronger.## What about food and fluids at end of life? Eating less in advanced dementia is expected as a part of the progression to end of life (EOL). At this point, the goal of care is to provide comfort only. Residents at EOL may not be able to swallow safely without choking or aspirating. There is a reduction in appetite and thirst as the body slowly shuts down.",

Withdrawal of food/fluid when no longer tolerated or desired allows the disease to progress on its natural course.### Enteral Feeding/Tube Feeding (PEG)\nIf a resident is unable to meet their needs orally, the family may choose an enteral feed (PEG) as an option to increase the nutrient intake. However, studies do not show that PEG feeding improves nutrition, reduces pain, prevents or heals pressure sores, reduces aspiration or aspiration pneumonia, or extends life. There is a higher risk (50‑70%) of complications such as aspiration, feeding tube obstruction, tube migration, gastro-intestinal bleeding, infection, fluid overload, etc.----**Document Metadata:**\n- **Policy Number:** [Insert Policy Number]\n- **Effective Date:** [Insert Effective Date]\n- **Review Date:** [Insert Review Date]# Nutrition in Dementia## What is Dementia?
