## Formula for Calculation of Infection Rates

1. **Formula used for calculating the infection rate per 1,000 Resident Days:**
\[
\text{(Number of infections x 1,000)} / \text{(Actual number of days in a month x Number of beds)}
\]

2. **Formula used for calculating the average quarterly infection rate per 1,000 Resident Days:**
\[
\text{(Total number of infections x 1,000)} / \text{(Average number of days in 3 months x 3 months x Number of beds)}
\]

3. **Formula used for calculating rate of Antibiotic Resistant Organisms (ARO) infections:**
\[
\text{Number of cases over specified time period (e.g., surveillance)} \times 10,000 / \text{(Total number of resident/resident days)}
\]
\[
\text{(Total number of cases divided by the (actual number of days in a month x number of beds) times 10,000)}
\]

4. **Formula used for calculating rate of Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) in residents with indwelling catheters per 1,000 catheter days (device associated infection rates):**
\[
\text{# of UTIs in residents with indwelling catheters} / \text{# of catheter days (total number of days each resident had an indwelling catheter added together in the month)} \times 1,000
\]

### Note for Point Click Care (PCC) users:
- Resident Day numbers are calculated in PCC.
- Can be obtained under the ADMIN tab:
- Report in gold bar
- ADT/Profile - Census
- Run report - number in the last row or ask your Office Manager for this number when month end reports are run.
