## POLICY

### Cleaning and Organization

## PROCEDURE

### Collect the following items:
- Pressure sprayer (2 gallon)
- Wall washing kit
- Large laundry bin cart
- Disinfectant cleaner
- Cleaning cloths
- Personal Protective Equipment

### Frequency:
- Laundry chutes will be cleaned on a regular schedule – twice a year and as needed.
- Laundry chutes will be cleaned according to schedule.

### Laundry Chute Cleaning:
1. Notify the nursing department in advance of the scheduled chute cleaning. Specify the time period during which the laundry chute will not be in service.
2. Post a sign at each access door to the chute indicating that laundry chute cleaning is in progress and the chute is not in service.
3. Place a bushel bin in the laundry room where the chute empties to act as a catch basin for cleaning solution and water.
4. Start the cleaning procedure at the top floor access to the chute.
5. Apply the disinfectant cleaner to the entire inner surface area of the chute.
6. Allow the solution to dwell on the surface for the manufacturer’s recommended contact/dwell time.
7. Using the wall washing kit or similar, scrub the inner surface of the chute to the lower floor’s access door opening. Ensure the inner surface of the chute door is cleaned as well.
8. Continue with this process until the entire inner surface of the laundry chute has been cleaned.
9. If it is required, return to the top floor access door and rinse the inner surface with water. Move to the next lower level and repeat this process to the bottom level.
10. Remove all signage posted at the access doors and notify nursing staff they can again access the laundry chute. Perform final cleanup of the catch bin and chute access door in the laundry.
11. Notify the manager or designate that the cleaning is completed.
