# Abbreviations and Definitions

## Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs)
Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are infections that residents can get in a healthcare facility while receiving medical care.

## Hand hygiene
A general term referring to any action of hand cleansing. Handrubbing with an alcohol-based handrub or handwashing with soap and water aimed at reducing or inhibiting the growth of microorganisms on hands.

## Healthcare activity
A succession of tasks during which healthcare workers’ hands touch different types of surfaces – resident, body fluids, objects or surfaces located in the resident environment.

## Hand hygiene moments
Refers to the four times it is essential that hand hygiene be performed by the healthcare worker:
- Before initial resident/environment contact
- After aseptic procedure
- After body fluid exposure risk
- After resident/environment contact

It is justified by the risk of organism transmission from one surface to another.

## Hand hygiene opportunity
It is a time during healthcare activities when hand hygiene is necessary to interrupt germ transmission by hands. It constitutes the denominator for calculating hand hygiene compliance, i.e., the proportion of times that HCWs perform hand hygiene of all observed moments when this was required.

## Observation
The act of observing another individual’s hand hygiene technique during an audit.

## Handrubbing
Applying an antiseptic handrub to reduce or inhibit the growth of microorganisms without the need of water and requiring no rinsing or drying with towels or other devices.

## Invasive medical device
A medical device inserted either through the skin or a mucous membrane or through a natural orifice. Aseptic techniques are required for all invasive medical devices.

## Infection
Invasion by and multiplication of pathogenic microorganisms in a bodily part or tissue, which may produce subsequent tissue injury and progress to overt disease through a variety of cellular or toxic mechanisms.

## Automatic Miss
During observations, automatic misses are noted when:
- A handrub dispenser (ABHR) is not working or is empty and healthcare worker continues
- No action
- If healthcare worker is wearing rings (does not include wedding band)
- Wearing wrist accessories
- Long nails, chipped nail polish, artificial nails, nail enhancements, nail art (Note: In Saskatchewan nail polish is not permitted)
- Hand hygiene is shorter than 20 seconds

## Healthcare Workers
Healthcare workers include all people primarily engaged in actions with the primary intent of enhancing health. Examples include:
- Nursing
- Healthcare aides
- Personal support workers
- Doctors/nurse practitioners
- Environmental services
- Other staff who work in the long-term care home.

# Break the Chain of Infection

## Infectious Agent
### Susceptible Host
### Reservoir

----

Hand hygiene breaks the chain of infection at the Mode of Transmission link. Hands move micro-organisms from one person/place to another. Hand hygiene refers to removing or killing microorganisms on the hands. In healthcare, hand hygiene is used to eliminate transient microorganisms that have been picked up via contact with residents, contaminated equipment, or the environment. During the delivery of care, HCWs’ hands continuously touch surfaces and substances including inanimate equipment, residents’ intact or non-intact skin, mucous membranes, food, waste, and body fluids. When performed correctly, good hand hygiene is one of the single most effective measures for preventing the spread of organisms that cause infection.¹

> “Adherence to hand hygiene recommendations is the single most important practice for preventing the transmission of microorganisms in healthcare and directly contributes to patient safety.”

### Did you know?
- 80% of infectious diseases are spread by hands.
- Hand hygiene is critical in preventing illness-related absences.
- Canadian workers missed an average of 10.3 workdays due to illness and disability in 2019.
- Only 85% of people wash their hands after using the bathroom, only 39% wash after coughing or sneezing into their hands, and only 77% wash hands before preparing food.
- Improved handwashing in the workplace can result in a 31% reduction in gastrointestinal illnesses (vomiting and diarrhea) and a 21% reduction in respiratory illnesses (common colds and flu).
- Hospital-acquired infections are the most common serious complication of hospitalization and the fourth leading cause of death among Canadians.

# Practising Hand Hygiene

Compliance or non-compliance with hand hygiene has consequences for the transmission of pathogens and the development of Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs). Hand hygiene is not just an option, a matter of common sense or merely an opportunity; it corresponds to opportunities during care delivery that are justified by the risk of the transmission of microorganisms. Hand hygiene is part of routine practices and is a requirement before and after any direct resident or environmental contact or when handling any soiled articles such as soiled laundry or equipment.

Barriers to hand hygiene compliance include:
- Lack of access to handwashing sinks
- ABHR dispensers
- Insufficient time
- Skin irritation
- Ignorance about the problem
- Individual preferences
- Poor habits

The process of performing effective hand hygiene, whether rubbing with an alcohol-based handrub or handwashing, is dependent on a number of factors:
- The quality of the alcohol-based product
- The amount of product used
- The time spent rubbing or washing
- The hand surface rubbed or washed.

## A Safe Pair of Hands

Hand hygiene helps prevent the spread of infectious diseases. A number of infectious diseases can be spread from one person to another by contaminated hands. These diseases include gastrointestinal infections, such as salmonellosis, and respiratory infections, such as colds, influenza, and COVID-19. Proper hand hygiene can help prevent the spread of the microorganisms (like bacteria and viruses) that cause these diseases and infections, especially for the elderly or those with a weakened immune system.

### Before You Start

Hand hygiene actions are more effective when:
- Hand skin is free of cuts
- Nails are natural, short
- Hands and forearms are free of jewellery and left uncovered

- Be aware that skin underneath jewellery rings is more heavily colonized by germs than comparable areas of skin on fingers without rings; therefore, wearing jewellery encourages the presence and survival of transient flora. Extendicare’s policy limits hand and arm jewellery: Rings must be a single smooth band without projections or mounted stones. If a watch is worn, it must be positioned above the wrist to ensure that proper hand hygiene is performed.

- Wearing artificial nails contributes to the transmission of certain healthcare-associated pathogens, so these are not permitted (Note: In Saskatchewan, nail polish is not permitted).

# Handrubbing

Hand hygiene may be practised by rubbing hands with an alcohol-based handrub. The technique for doing this, as well as the product used, render hands free from potentially harmful contamination and make them safe for resident care.

## Handrubbing with an Alcohol-Based Formulation

The most effective way to ensure optimal hand hygiene is by using an alcohol-based handrub (ABHR). According to the WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Healthcare, when an alcohol-based handrub is available, it should be used as the preferred means for routine hand antisepsis.

### Immediate Advantages of Alcohol-Based Handrubs

- Elimination of the majority of germs (including viruses)
- The short time required (15 seconds)
- Availability of the product at the point of care
- Good skin tolerability
- No need for any particular infrastructure (clean water supply network, washbasin, soap, hand towel)

## How to Handrub (3 Set Poster)

1. Apply 1 to 2 pumps of product to palms of dry hands.
2. Rub hands together; palm to palm:
- Rub in between and around fingers.
- Rub back of each hand with palm of other hand.
- Rub fingertips of each hand in opposite palm.
- Rub each thumb clasped in opposite hand.
3. Rub hands until product is dry. Do not use paper towels.

Once dry, your hands are safe.

**Note:** Soap and alcohol-based handrub should not be used simultaneously. To comply with routine hand hygiene recommendations, hand hygiene should ideally be performed where and when care is provided, which means at the point of care and at the moments indicated. Often, this calls for the use of an alcohol-based product.

# Handwashing

Hand hygiene may be practised by washing with soap and water. The technique for doing this, as well as lathering for at least 15 seconds, render hands free from potentially harmful contamination and make them safe for resident care.

## Handwashing

Hands need to be washed with soap and water when they are visibly dirty or soiled with blood or other body fluids, when exposure to potential spore-forming organisms is strongly suspected or proven, or after using the bathroom. Use running water instead of a basin of standing water that could become contaminated through use. Avoid hot water that can damage the skin’s natural oils which over time, can cause dermatitis.

### Soap is important:

Washing hands with soap and water will remove substantially more disease-causing organisms than washing hands with water alone.

### No advantage to using antibacterial soap:

When following the correct handwashing steps, all soaps are equally effective at removing disease-causing germs. Antibacterial soap is unnecessary and does not offer an advantage over regular soap.

## Hand Hygiene using Soap and Running Water

Hands must be rubbed together making a soapy lather for at least 15 seconds without washing lather away. Wash the front and back of hands and wrists as well as between fingers and under nails. Complete the process by rinsing the hands.

- **Do not use bar soap.**
- Bar soap is for single-resident personal use ONLY and should be labelled with the resident’s name.

Although handwashing with cold water and soap is acceptable, warm water is better than cold, as soap lathers (soaps up) more effectively with warm water.

# Top Tips

## Hand Hygiene
The following tips are recommended for general hand hygiene:

- **The 15 Second Rule!** Remember, it should take approximately 15 seconds of rubbing action to clean your hands.
- Always cover any cuts with a waterproof bandage.
- Remember to pay special attention to the finger tips, thumbs, and between the fingers as these areas are frequently missed.
- Are you left or right handed? Be aware that right handed people have a tendency to scrub the left hand more thoroughly (and vice versa).

### Tips for Handwashing
The following tips are recommended when handwashing:

- Rub hands together to work up a lather with the plain soap. Follow the appropriate hand hygiene steps to ensure all surfaces of both hands are clean. No half measures! If you’re washing your hands, wet them thoroughly with water before applying soap.
- Make sure you rinse all the soap off your hands under running water and then pat dry your hands thoroughly.

Handwashing is only one part of hand hygiene. Looking after your skin generally is important, as your skin is your most effective barrier against infection.

## Skin Care
The following aspects should be taken into consideration to ensure good skin condition²:

- Washing with soap and water is harsher on the skin than handrubbing with ABHR.
- Certain detergent and antiseptic soaps cause more irritation than others.

### Behaviours to Avoid
The following behaviours should be avoided:

- Using soap and water and alcohol-based products simultaneously.
- Using hot water for washing hands with soap and water.
- Donning gloves when hands are wet, as this can cause irritation.
- Wearing gloves at times when not required (i.e., walking down hallways).

### Principles to Follow
The following principles should be followed:

- Rub hands until the alcohol-based product has completely evaporated.
- Dry hands carefully after washing with soap and water.
- Regularly apply a protective hand cream to protect your hands and help to prevent dryness and hand chapping.

# Gloves

- It is important to realize that the use of gloves does not change the number of opportunities for healthcare workers to clean their hands.
- Hand hygiene must occur before and after each time gloves are worn.
- Refer to the PPE Guide for more information on appropriate glove use.

## Hand Hygiene Prior to Accessing Gloves (Clean Supplies)

One of the most frequently missed hand hygiene opportunities in healthcare is performing hand hygiene prior to accessing clean supplies. Clean hands will ensure the gloves and the glove box remain uncontaminated and avoid potentially transmitting harmful pathogens.

## Hand Hygiene After Using Gloves

Contamination of wrists can also occur during glove removal. It is estimated that up to 5% of gloves may have microtears which will allow microorganisms to contaminate the hands of the healthcare worker. Contamination of wrists can also occur during glove removal.

# The Four Moments of Hand Hygiene

| Moment | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1      | Before contact with resident or resident environment |
| 2      | Before start of activity, program, or one-to-one visit |
| 3      | After contact with resident or resident environment |
| 4      | After contact with resident or resident environment |

**Page 11**

# When to Practise Hand Hygiene

Hand hygiene opportunities can be categorized into four moments during resident care. Knowing, understanding, and recognizing these moments are the pillars on which effective hand hygiene is based. If healthcare workers promptly identify these opportunities (moments) and respond to them by complying with hand hygiene actions, it is possible to prevent healthcare-associated infections caused by cross-transmission via hands. The right action at the right moment is a guarantee of safe resident care.

Following the four moments framework, hand hygiene must be performed:

## 1. Before Initial Resident/Resident Environment Contact
- If a healthcare worker touches the resident’s environment and then is going to touch the resident
- Goes directly to touch the resident after having touched any other surface not in the resident’s environment or another resident’s environment (same room)
- If the healthcare worker enters the resident’s environment from outside and touches only the resident’s environment then leaves

## 2. Before Aseptic Procedures
- Prior to performing an aseptic procedure if the healthcare worker has touched any other surface including the resident or their environment.
- Prior to touching a body site to perform wound care – dressing change or wound assessment
- Prior to manipulating an invasive device

## 3. After Body Fluid Exposure Risk
- If the healthcare worker has been engaged in a care activity involving a risk of body fluid exposure and before touching any other surface
- If the healthcare worker has been engaged in a care activity involving a risk of body fluid exposure and before touching the resident or another resident

## 4. After Resident/Resident Environment Contact
- If the healthcare worker is leaving the resident and the resident’s environment to go out of the room or to another resident in the same room
- If the healthcare worker is leaving the resident area after touching objects in the resident’s environment (not even touching resident) to go on working outside the room or with another resident

# Hand Hygiene Audits

Audits play a pivotal role in monitoring hand hygiene compliance. Auditing practices along with surveillance of infection data can identify gaps and strengths in infection prevention practices.

## Responsibilities

- The home should designate champions to complete the minimum number of hand hygiene observations and sessions monthly.
- These staff members must be educated on correct hand hygiene procedures and completion of audits on Surge.
- The Infection Control Professional (ICP) must evaluate and report on the home’s overall results at IPAC Committee Meetings and at PAC/MAC meetings quarterly.
- Compliance with hand hygiene practices must be reported and plans for improvement initiated if compliance rates are less than 95%.
- Compliance rates are reported in the yearly evaluation of the home’s IPAC Program.

## Audit Completion

Hand hygiene audits can be completed at the discretion of the home to ensure hand hygiene is completed correctly and using the 4 Moments framework, when applicable.

- The home’s ICP/designate will review compliance rates for hand hygiene at least monthly and develop/implement action plan(s) to increase compliance, if needed.
- To learn about audit action plans, refer to the Interpreting Audits page of this guidance document.

## Tracking

The Hand Hygiene Audit must be completed on Surge’s QRM system OR HealthConnex for tracking purposes.

# Interpreting Audits

When interpreting the results of your hand hygiene audits, it is recommended that they are analyzed at least monthly. If an outbreak is declared, the audits must be reviewed daily. The following should be reviewed:

1. Look at the areas of your home that were audited. If the home is not in an outbreak, it should be about the same number per floor/unit/household. If there is an area that has been declared in outbreak, concentrate on that area but do not forget the remainder of the home.
2. Review which shifts have been audited ensuring that night shift is completed each month.
3. Review the departments audited. You may organize yourself and have a department that you want to focus on so there will be more audits completed. You may want to follow up to see an improvement in a department so have targeted that. In an outbreak concentrate on the departments going in and out of resident rooms.
4. All moments of hand hygiene should be audited where possible with emphasis on “Before and After Resident” and “Before and After Environment”. “Before Donning” and “After Doffing” should be completed monthly with an emphasized focus during an outbreak.
5. Automatic misses should be reviewed, and measures put in place to eliminate (education, better placement of ABHR, better process to ensure ABHR is functioning or refilled when needed).
6. If your hand hygiene compliance rates are 95% or less, a plan to improve compliance is required.

## How to create an audit action plan for improving hand hygiene compliance

When creating a strategic action plan, the simplest method is to base your action plan on audit findings raised in the audit report. Add notes and prioritize the elements. Expand and break down each element into the necessary steps. This will help to ensure that the steps are small and manageable goals so that you can stay on track and keep focus. Remember to monitor the audit action plan to ensure that the responsibilities assigned are carried out effectively and consistently.

# Resident Hand Hygiene

Resident involvement is a core component of a successful hand hygiene program. Residents often require assistance with handwashing as a part of their own personal hygiene, especially before eating and after toileting. Residents with dementia, cognitive impairment, and functional decline present further challenges. Research demonstrates that homes with a hand hygiene program that involved resident participation resulted in improved compliance and lower infection rates.³

One component of a successful program is the provision of hand wipes in group dining rooms and on meal trays. Whenever possible, educate residents about hand hygiene and assist with hand hygiene when needed. Post signage throughout the home, including the recognition of a home champion. Consider recognizing a new champion each month so that these familiar faces can be publicized on a rotational basis.

Be sure to include residents as part of the hand hygiene program. There is an audit on Surge which should be used to ensure staff are offering assistance or encouraging residents to clean their hands. The audit identifies times where good hand hygiene is needed:

- Before and after meals/snacks
- Before leaving the home/home area
- Before and after activities
- After sneezing
- Before medications
- After entering the home/home area

A resident should:

- Be offered the opportunity to clean their hands after using the toilet or commode.
- Be offered the opportunity to clean their hands before meals or drinks.

# IPAC Champions

## Creating a Champion Team
Infection Control Professionals (ICPs) are responsible for ensuring the number of hand hygiene audits are completed monthly. Depending on the size of your home, it is recommended ICPs create a team to assist in the monthly audits. Hand hygiene audits should be delegated and monitored for compliance by the ICP. Auditors should include but are not limited to IPAC Champions and Department Managers.

**Note:** IPAC Champions can be any staff member in the home.

The strength of an IPAC Champion is that they know the reality on their unit. Their grassroots knowledge will help determine the best ways to improve hand hygiene practices and promote the hand hygiene message to their colleagues.

## Involve Colleagues
By asking staff what would make it easier for them to practice better hand hygiene or discussing the perceived barriers to good hand hygiene practices and thinking of what solutions might be, you will develop a culture of hand-hygiene compliance.

## Recognize the Heroes
Do you have a team member that goes above and beyond the call of duty with respect to hand hygiene? If so, celebrate your hard-working co-worker(s) by nominating them as an IPAC Champion.

## Expect Resistance
Ensure colleagues are as involved as possible; use their dissent to generate solutions. Don’t let a few individuals derail efforts; proceed with plans. Get advice from a more senior member of the team for suggestions.

## Have Fun!
Engaging ideas are more likely to get staff interested. Show your commitment to hand hygiene by creating a piece of art. Ask staff to dip their hands in different colored paint and make a pattern out of handprints. Hang it proudly in your area as a reminder of their efforts.

Ensure all IPAC Champions receive the appropriate training to ensure success. The ICP should provide one-on-one education by completing real-time audits on the floor with the new Champion. This ensures that the staff member has a good understanding of the process and expectations when completing hand hygiene audits. All Champions must review the education provided and this guidance document, **The Hand Hygiene Guide**.

# Promote Hand Hygiene in Your Home

## IPAC Champions, Continued

### Communication is Key!
If you observe a staff member that missed one of the 4 Moments of Hand Hygiene, here are a few approaches:

- Always look for and point out what was done correctly first then make your observation
- Always provide direction/education in the moment in a positive manner
- Provide positive feedback
- Make it about them… “Hand hygiene protects you and your family.”
- Recognize first… “I want to thank you for remembering to sanitize your hand before you went into the room and just a friendly reminder to always sanitize your hands when you leave as well.”

### A Supportive Culture
A supportive culture is very important for hand hygiene improvement: A supportive culture is a just culture where everyone feels safe, encouraged, and enabled to discuss quality and safety concerns. Hand hygiene is important not only for the safety of residents but for the healthcare worker as well. It is important that there is a respectful and trusting environment for everyone to bring forward questions or concerns about hand hygiene practices.

Be respectful and compassionate in how you engage with those involved. Ask yourself:

- Would a resident feel empowered to ask my team to clean their hands before providing care?
- Is my team open to receiving feedback about their hand hygiene practices? Be open about the evaluation processes used and strive for excellence.
- Does my team understand how reviews are performed? Hold our system, ourselves and others accountable?
- Does each member of my team feel comfortable reminding their co-workers to perform hand hygiene as necessary? Learn from mistakes and close calls to improve safety and performance.

### Create an Environment for Success
Why is a successful environment important to hand hygiene? The hand hygiene environment includes not only the physical environment, but also how people interact. Strong leadership and accountability are important in influencing hand hygiene practices. Hand hygiene is everyone’s responsibility, but successful hand hygiene needs leadership support to make it a priority related to patient safety.

# IPAC Champions, continued

## Get Started
Ensure your team has the tools (products, infrastructure, and education) they need for proper hand hygiene practices.

## Staff Training and Education
Staff training and education is fundamental to an effective hand hygiene program. Education provides foundational knowledge, increases awareness, and reminds staff about the importance of hand hygiene. If staff do not receive effective training and education about hand hygiene, they may not perform the hand hygiene required to adequately protect themselves and their residents. As part of their education, this guidance document should be given to them.

## Take it to the Next Level!
A team can increase hand hygiene practice by creating a culture where reminding each other about hand hygiene is encouraged and compliance is the social norm. Shifting attitudes and behavior takes time, but improving hand hygiene compliance will happen when hand hygiene is genuinely believed to be an essential element of ensuring patient safety and improving patient outcomes.

## Suggested Team Size
Here is a suggestion for building the size of your team:

| Number of Beds | Audits Planned                | Number of Suggested IPAC Champions | Management HH Champions                          |
|----------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| ≤ 70           | 2 daily covering all 3 shifts | One IPAC Champion for each shift = 3 | Dietary Manager, Environmental Services Manager, Activation Manager |
| 71-140         | 3 daily covering all 3 shifts | Two IPAC Champions for each shift = 6 | Dietary Manager, Environmental Services Manager, Activation Manager |
| 141-210        | 4 daily covering all 3 shifts | Three IPAC Champions for each shift = 9 | Dietary Manager, Environmental Services Manager, Activation Manager |
| ≥ 211          | 5 daily covering all 3 shifts | Four IPAC Champions for each shift = 12 | Dietary Manager, Environmental Services Manager, Activation Manager |
