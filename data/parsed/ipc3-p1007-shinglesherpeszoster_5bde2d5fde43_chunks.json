If circumstances make this necessary, PPE (i.e., gloves and gown) must be worn. - If localized lesions cannot be covered (e.g., on the fingers), the resident should be placed on Contact Precautions until all lesions have crusted.",

If the resident is out of their room, they must wear a surgical/procedure mask and have skin lesions covered. - Susceptible individuals should not enter or occupy the room. If circumstances make this necessary, an N95 respirator must be worn. - Keep the resident in a room away from susceptible, immunocompromised residents. - Antivirals should be initiated based on physician or nurse practitioner orders, as soon as possible.----**Helping people live better**\nThis document is uncontrolled when printed.

For those who have received varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) and where immunocompromised individuals are involved, surveillance should continue for 28 days.## Management – Staff with Shingles\n- Staff with localized shingles should cover lesions with a dressing and where possible, with clothing when working. - If localized lesions cannot be covered (e.g., on the fingers) staff will be excluded from work until lesions are crusted.",
