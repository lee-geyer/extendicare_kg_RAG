# Mechanical Sit/Stand Active Lifts

## Barbara Carl

| Lift Model         | SWL (Safe Working Load) |
|--------------------|-------------------------|
| Sara® 3000        | 440 lbs                 |
| Sara® Stedy       | 400 lbs                 |
| Sara® Flex        | 440 lbs                 |

### Overview
SARA lifts (Standing And Raising Aid) are designed to support residents in a way that encourages their own mobility while minimizing physical strain on caregivers. They’re commonly used for transfers between a bed and chair, or for toileting purposes.

# Mechanical Passive or Ceiling Lifts

| Device Name          | SWL       |
|----------------------|-----------|
| Maxi 500             | 500 lbs   |
| MaxiMove®           | 500 lbs   |
| Maxi Sky® 2         | 600 lbs   |

These devices are designed to support residents with little to no mobility. These lifts provide full-body support during transfers while minimizing physical strain on caregivers. Common uses include:

- Bed-to-chair transfers
- Repositioning
- Toileting

# Sling Selection

## Arjo Sizing Guidelines

Arjo provides colour-coded guidelines specific to sling type to support accurate sizing and selection. These guidelines show where to measure the patient and how this is used to find the correct size (example for Passive loop slings below).

### Measurement Instructions

1. Measure from the patient's coccyx/seat (A) to the top of the head.
2. Measure the patient's low hip circumference.

### Sizing Chart

| Size | Top of Head to Coccyx (cm) | Top of Head to Coccyx (in) | Low Hip Circumference (cm) | Low Hip Circumference (in) |
|------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| M    | 65-71                       | 25.5-28                     | 79-99                       | 31-39.5                     |
| M    | 72-79                       | 28.5-31                     | 100-116                     | 40-45.5                     |
| M    | 80-85                       | 31.5-33.5                   | 117-133                     | 46-52.5                     |
| XL   | 86-93                       | 34-36.5                     | 134-154                     | 53-60.5                     |
| XXL  | 94-105                      | 37-41.5                     | 155-170                     | 61-67                       |

# Bathing

## System 2000

### Designed to provide safe, dignified, and comfortable bathing experience for residents in long-term care homes.

These specialized tubs support residents with varying mobility levels, from fully dependent to semi-independent, while helping reduce the physical strain on caregivers. Combined with compatible lifting and transfer systems (like the Alenti, Miranti, or ceiling lifts), they allow for efficient, hygienic, and ergonomically safe bathing routines that promote resident safety, comfort, and infection control.
