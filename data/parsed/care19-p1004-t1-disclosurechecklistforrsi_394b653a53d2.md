### Disclosure Requirements
Disclosure of resident safety incidents to residents, their Substitute Decision Maker (SDM) or Power of Attorney for Care (POA) is required as soon as reasonably possible after an incident.

For direction on disclosures to police, review the **Disclosures to Police Procedure** in the **Privacy and Confidentiality Manual**.

### Initial Disclosure
- Notify resident/SDM/POA of incident as soon as possible. Communicate facts of what occurred, impact, and any immediate follow-up actions that have been taken.

### Planning for the Disclosure - Things to Consider
- Respect privacy and confidentiality. Do not release any documents regarding the incident without consulting with **Privacy_Officer@extendicare.com** and obtaining written consent from the resident or Substitute Decision-Maker (SDM).
- If it is believed that personal health information (PHI) of another resident is required to be disclosed, express consent is required by the resident/SDM. If express consent is not obtained, contact **Privacy_Officer@extendicare.com** prior to any disclosure.
- Do not include PHI in internal or external email communication. Mark all emails and other written documents pertaining to the incident “privileged and confidential – for patient safety purposes only.” Circulate only as needed and only to individuals who require the information and are authorized to receive it.
- Express empathy and compassion throughout the meeting.
- Anticipate resident/SDM/POA emotions and ensure support is available, including who the resident chooses to be part of any discussion such as family, friends, or spiritual representatives. Offer practical and emotional support, as required, to the resident, their family, and to any staff involved.
- Be aware of your emotions as well as the emotions of those providers involved in the process. Seek support if necessary.

- Be the point of contact for the resident/family
- Support any staff involved in the incident
4. **Consider involving** the most responsible physician or attending clinician most familiar to the family.

## Steps for Disclosure Meeting

1. **Welcome and introduce the participants.**
2. **Describe the facts** that have been confirmed about the RSI and its outcome known at the time. Use language and terminology that is appropriate for the resident and any participants. Be sensitive to cultural and language needs. Avoid speculation, premature conclusions, or blame.

4. **Express empathy and compassion** even if the circumstances/causes of the event are not yet known. Acknowledge any distress the resident/family are experiencing.

6. **Provide time for questions** and take steps to confirm the information you have communicated has been understood by all participants.
7. **Invite the resident and/or family** to discuss the event from their point of view.
8. **At the end of the meeting,** review the discussion and prepare a written meeting summary to be included in the resident’s medical record. Make note of what was communicated and any decisions that were reached. Provide all participants an opportunity to review the meeting summary.
9. **Offer to arrange subsequent meetings.** Provide key contact information in case any questions or concerns arise.
10. **Reimburse expenses** related to the disclosure process and/or waive accommodation or other fees as appropriate and agreed to by Regional Director/Operations.
