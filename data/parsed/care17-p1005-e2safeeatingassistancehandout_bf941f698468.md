# Extendicare Safe Eating Assistance

Knowledge and use of techniques for safe eating assistance can increase the residents’ overall health and wellness, quality of life, dignity, self-worth, and independence. In addition, proper techniques reduce the risk of dysphagia and dysphagia-related complications, such as aspiration pneumonia.

## Strategies for Assisting Residents with Eating

### Proper Positioning

- Ensure the resident is sitting in an upright position, as close to a 90-degree angle as possible.
- Their back should be flat against the back of the chair and their spine should be in a neutral position with their shoulders in-line with their hips. This includes most residents who are sitting in wheelchairs (see below).
- Ensure the resident’s feet and arms are supported which will increase their stability. Use additional support if necessary to promote proper positioning (e.g., pillows, towels, or blankets to support the head, neck, and trunk).
- Ensure the resident’s head is as close to a 90-degree angle as possible. The head should not be tilted to the side or extended backwards. The chin should be tilted slightly downward towards the chest which protects the windpipe (called a chin-tuck).
- If the resident has poor muscle tone and is pulled forward by gravity when they lean forward past the upright, 90-degree position, producing a chin tuck can be more difficult. However, a chin tuck can be produced while the person is sitting in a slightly reclined/tilted position (to avoid the impact of gravity) by supporting the shoulders and head. A neck pillow can provide support for the head and placing rolled hand towels or small pillows under the shoulders can help shoulder positioning. In this way, the pull of gravity is overcome and yet a chin tuck is produced (i.e., this is similar to the position that you would be in if you wanted to watch television while lying in bed).
- Ensure the table is positioned at a suitable height (e.g., adjust the seat or the table). The resident should also be seated close to the table to ensure proper support, comfort, and ease with eating (e.g., reaching their food). The resident’s food, utensils, and drink should be within their functional reach.
- If a resident is sitting in a geri chair, tilt chair, air chair, etc., and cannot reach the table, ensure they have a lap tray or table available for their meal or that someone is able to assist them in eating.
- If a resident is required to remain in bed for mealtime, raise the head of the bed as close to 90 degrees as tolerated and place supports behind the resident’s head and shoulders, so their head is positioned midline and at a 90-degree angle with a chin-tuck.
- It is important to encourage the resident to remain in an upright position for at least 30 minutes after each meal. This helps to reduce reflux and clear any residue left in the oral or pharyngeal cavity, reducing the risk of these materials being aspirated at a later time.

# Mealtime Assistance Guidelines

## Introduction
If there are concerns with the resident’s seating or positioning, make a referral to the Physiotherapist or Occupational Therapist.

## Dietary Considerations
- Ensure that the correct diet type, food texture, and fluid consistencies are provided by referring to the nutrition profile or “diet sheet”.
- Be aware of any specific feeding/assistance techniques required (as outlined in the plan of care).

## Oral Care
- Provide oral care before and after meals to remove any harmful bacteria or food residue. This reduces the impact of materials if they are aspirated.
- Ensure that the resident’s face and hands are washed prior to mealtime.
- Ensure that staff wash their hands prior to helping during mealtime.

## Resident Readiness
- Ensure that the resident is alert and responsive during mealtimes. Provide verbal and tactile cues to help maintain alertness as necessary.
- Do not assist a resident who is not alert or responsive.

## Fluid Management
- Provide sips of fluid at the start of the meal to moisten the resident’s mouth.
- Encourage or provide sips of fluid every few bites to help moisten the mouth. This will make it easier for the resident to control the food in their mouth.

## Assistance Techniques
- Assist from a seated position and not from above the resident as this can encourage the resident to flex their head upwards and backwards. If the resident sits in a highchair, staff may need to stand to be at the correct level.
- Assist the resident from his/her strong side.
- Assist at a slow controlled pace, ensuring that the resident has time to chew and swallow between bites.
- Ensure that the resident has swallowed their food or drink before they take more or before staff offers more.

## Communication Cues
- If the resident has visual or cognitive impairments, provide them with verbal cues:
- Describe the food (e.g., what it is, what it looks like, smells like)
- Provide notice when bringing food to the resident’s mouth
- Inform them of the position of their utensils
- Ensure that the necessary utensils are easily within reach.

- If the resident has cognitive impairments, you may need to cue them on the use of the different utensils and the steps involved with safe eating.
- For residents who have a hearing impairment, ensure that you sit close to them so they can see you when you are talking to them. Talk in a clear voice. If they have one ear that has better hearing acuity, talk closer to that side.

## Food Presentation
- Offer one course at a time. Avoid mixing foods together as they may have different flavours, textures, or consistencies which could increase the residents’ chewing and swallowing difficulty.
- Mealtime is traditionally a very social event; however, discourage residents from talking while they are chewing or swallowing. If they want to communicate, encourage them to do so in between bites of food or sips of fluid.

## Sensory Aids
- Ensure the resident is wearing sensory aids such as eyeglasses, hearing aids, and dentures.
- Ensure sensory aids are in good working order (e.g., hearing aids are turned on, dentures are securely fastened).

# Resident Mealtime Assistance Guidelines

## Introduction
Be aware of any verbal or non-verbal cues that a resident may use to communicate discomfort (e.g., sounds, gestures, actions, facial expressions, body language, eye gaze, etc.). Ensure that the meal provided for the resident is consistent with their recommended diet. Offer the resident the most nutritious food items first (e.g., protein, casseroles, milk) and offer desserts last. This helps to ensure that residents are meeting their nutritional needs. Nutritional supplements should be provided as recommended, usually after the meal has been consumed. Once eating and drinking has finished, check the resident’s oral cavity for food/fluid residue and clear as appropriate either by cueing the resident to spit it out or assisting the resident by completing a swab/finger sweep (in emergency situations).

## Providing Verbal and Physical Assistance
Residents should be encouraged in their independence during mealtimes. If residents require prompting to experience success, only the minimal level of prompting should be provided in order to achieve independent success. Provide residents with and request feedback from them to ensure that they understand the tasks. When describing the food to the resident, always use positive words and an encouraging tone of voice. Be attentive to your body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice when interacting with residents. If a resident requires an ample amount of time, be sure to remain patient and positive in your appearance. It is important for residents to have enough time to eat and for the mealtime experience to be relaxing and enjoyable. Provide visual and verbal cues as necessary for residents to chew and swallow food.

### Physical Assistance Based on Abilities
Provide physical assistance to the resident based on their abilities:
- Place food/utensil in their hand.
- Assist resident to scoop food onto utensil using underhand positioning.
- Cup their hand and assist movement to their mouth using underhand positioning.
- Position and reposition tableware to ensure food is in their visual range throughout the meal.
- If the resident requires total assistance, place the resident’s hand on staff’s forearm during the motion of food/utensil lifting to mouth.

## Environmental Modifications
The dining room environment is an integral part of the overall dining experience. Excessive noise, visual distractions, and room setup can have a significant impact on residents’ mealtime behavior and their experience. This can affect the safety and efficiency of the resident’s swallow. It is important to create an environment that is safe, comfortable, and productive for the residents.

# Vision and Hearing Considerations for Residents

## Vision
If a resident has a visual impairment, they may become easily disorientated and confused. This can lead to problematic behaviors such as agitation, repetitive questioning, refusal, etc. Some suggestions to address vision include:

- Arrange the tables directly under light fixtures.
- Angle tables away from any glare coming from windows or other shiny surfaces.
- Draw blinds to avoid glare.
- Avoid waxing or polishing floors as this can increase glare.
- Remove any mirrors as this can cause overstimulation for residents with dementia.
- If necessary, add additional light sources.
- Serve meals on brightly coloured dinnerware to increase contrast. Also, ensure there is colour contrast between the tablecloth or place mat and the dinnerware.
- If the resident has glasses, ensure glasses are clean and they are wearing them.
- Be aware of any visual neglect. Ensure you are sitting on their unaffected side as well as presenting food in their visual field.

## Hearing
It becomes increasingly challenging for residents, especially those with Alzheimer’s, to filter out background noise. It can result in residents becoming easily distracted, having difficulty comprehending language, or maintaining attention to the task of eating. Factors to consider that can help reduce the environmental noise include:

- Use surfaces that absorb sound such as drapes, acoustic tiles, or felt on the bottom of chairs.
- Be aware of the noise that is emitted from things such as fans and air conditioners.
- Turn off any extraneous noise such as the TV or radio. Soft music may contribute to the dining experience, which should be assessed by the Interdisciplinary team.
- Discourage a lot of visitors during mealtime as this can pose as a distraction to residents and create a lot of extra noise in the dining room.
- If the resident has hearing aids, ensure they are wearing them and they are in good working order.
- Reduce conversation between staff, focusing on resident conversation and cueing.

# Special Feeding Concerns and Techniques

## Coughing or Throat Clearing
If a resident experiences coughing or throat clearing, encourage them to clear their airway by continuing with a strong cough or throat clear. Do not give them a drink while they are still coughing as this can increase their risk of choking or aspiration.

## Residue or Pocketing Food in Mouth
If the resident frequently has residue or pocketed food after they swallow, try the following strategies:
- **a)** A verbal cue to perform a tongue sweep or to initiate productive tongue movements to help clear residue.
- **b)** A verbal cue to swallow twice (double swallow).
- **c)** Encourage the resident to take a sip of fluid after every few bites to help clear residue.

## Resists Food/Meals
If a resident resists food, re-approach them at a later time. Acknowledge their right to refuse to eat and report any refusals to the registered staff.

## Pocketing Food (Holding Food Prior to Swallow)
If the resident is pocketing food because of muscle weakness or decreased sensation, applying a slight pressure to the weak side of the cheek may be beneficial:
- **a)** The pressure can decrease the amount of food that can fall into the crevice.
- **b)** The pressure helps the tongue form a more cohesive bolus.
- **c)** The pressure may act as a tactile cue to increase awareness and sensation to that side of the mouth, allowing the resident to clear the food residue with their tongue.

If the resident is unable to clear the food from their mouth, it should be cleared by a health care worker.

## Drinking Too Quickly
Encourage the resident to sip liquids rather than gulp them. This allows for a more controlled and safer swallow. The resident should avoid flexing their neck backwards as this can result in premature spillage of the liquid into the throat. Avoid pouring fluid into the resident’s mouth. Straws are effective for some residents to facilitate their drinking. If a resident chokes or coughs when using a straw, refer to the Dietitian/Occupational Therapist for assessment. Specific types of drinking devices may be recommended to control the pace of drinking.

## Eating Too Quickly
If a resident eats or drinks too rapidly, limit their impulsivity by:
- Using a teaspoon rather than a tablespoon.
- Encouraging them to place their utensil down on the table after each bite.
- Presenting only one item or small portions of an item at a time.

## Resident Does Not Open Mouth
- Place the resident’s hand on staff’s forearm during the motion of food/utensil lifting to mouth.
- Touch a spoon to resident’s lip (cold spoon kept in ice water can be effective through a meal).
