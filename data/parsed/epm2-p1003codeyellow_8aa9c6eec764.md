## POLICY

### Emergency Response Codes

## PROCEDURE

Code Yellow is announced when a resident has been identified as missing. Residents are considered missing when they are not in a location where staff can find them and are not signed out of the home.

### Prevent

The Director of Care/Charge nurse will:
- Assess all residents upon admission for wandering and exit-seeking, reassess as required.
- Apply mitigation strategies for residents identified as exit-seeking:
- Wander guards
- Tailored behavioral programs
- Locked units
- Registered with Alzheimer's society wandering registry, etc.

The Executive Director/Designate will designate the following:
- Post a sign at all entrances/exits informing visitors to not assist/open doors for residents unless they know the resident is permitted to leave the home.
- When the home has planned downtime of maglock or locked doors in which the doors will be unlocked for any period of time, instruct staff to monitor doors until the downtime has ended to ensure no residents exit the building.
- Ensure all visitors or contracted services are aware of potential safety risks and are aware of a clear escalation pathway for concerns (e.g., direct them to the Director of Care).

### Respond

All Staff must follow the procedures for a missing resident as per their designated Job Action checklists and follow direction from the Incident Manager.
