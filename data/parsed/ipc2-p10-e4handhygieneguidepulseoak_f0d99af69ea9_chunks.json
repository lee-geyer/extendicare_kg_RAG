Looking after your skin generally is important, as your skin is your most effective barrier against infection.## Skin Care\nThe following aspects should be taken into consideration to ensure good skin condition²:- Washing with soap and water is harsher on the skin than handrubbing with ABHR. - Certain detergent and antiseptic soaps cause more irritation than others.### Behaviours to Avoid\nThe following behaviours should be avoided:- Using soap and water and alcohol-based products simultaneously. - Using hot water for washing hands with soap and water. - Donning gloves when hands are wet, as this can cause irritation. - Wearing gloves at times when not required (i.e., walking down hallways).### Principles to Follow\nThe following principles should be followed:- Rub hands until the alcohol-based product has completely evaporated. - Dry hands carefully after washing with soap and water. - Regularly apply a protective hand cream to protect your hands and help to prevent dryness and hand chapping.----**PAGE 9**```markdown",
