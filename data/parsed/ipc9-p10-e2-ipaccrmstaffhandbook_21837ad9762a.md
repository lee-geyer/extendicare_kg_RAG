## IPAC During Construction Renovation and Maintenance (CRM)
### Staff Handbook

#### Importance of IPAC during CRM
CRM activities have been directly linked to the spread of serious infections in healthcare facilities to residents, visitors, and staff. This is because CRM activities can disperse dust particles contaminated with bacteria and fungi into the air and cause health care-associated infections (HAIs).

IPAC measures must be planned, implemented, and evaluated before, during, and at the end of CRM activities in accordance with the CSA Z317.13:22 and other provincial guidelines that address the importance of IPAC during CRM activities.

It is a team effort to help prevent HAIs related to construction, renovation, and maintenance activity. From contractors to management, environmental services to front line staff, and infection prevention and control; we all have a part to play. This ensures that we keep our residents, visitors, and staff safe while construction projects are occurring.

Dust can carry pathogens, such as Legionella and fungal spores, which can lead to the spread of infectious particles in the air which can be inhaled by residents and/or contaminate the home.

#### Risks Associated with CRM in Long Term Care Facilities
CRMD in long-term care can pose a significant infection risk such as:

- **Infectious Agents**
- **Fungi (Moulds and Yeasts)**
- Aspergillus, Penicilium, Candida, Zygomycetes, Fusarium
- **Bacteria**
- Legionella, Bacillus, Nocardia, Nontuberculous mycobacteria

- **Susceptible Populations and High-Risk Setting**
- Elderly, immunocompromised
- Medication rooms, kitchens, resident rooms

- **Potential for Exposures**
- Contaminated dust, stagnant water, discovery of mould

The disturbance of the home’s structures and the generation of dust, no matter how minimal, may lead to a deadly infection or even outbreaks. The mortality rates associated with construction-linked infections are high, hence...

# Why Precautionary Measures Must Be Taken
Mortality rate can exceed 40% during all construction activities in the home.

## Would You Like to Know?
### Benefits of IPAC Measures
Implementing IPAC measures during the life of the project is of utter importance:
- Preventing possible infections and/or outbreaks.
- Preventing environmental contamination of the home.
- Avoiding investigations by outside stakeholders.
- The home saves more money by preventing unnecessary infections/outbreaks, investigations, and contamination.

### Legionella
- Bacteria that live in water and soil.
- Causes Legionnaires’ disease, a dangerous type of pneumonia.
- Mortality rate can be as high as 25-40%.
- Outbreak in LTC Home in Toronto where 20+ residents lost their lives.

### Aspergillus
- A common mold (a type of fungus) that lives indoors and outdoors.
- Survives in soil and dust and can be airborne when disrupted.
- Can lead to outbreaks of a fatal lung infection called invasive aspergillosis.

## How Does IPAC Assess Risk?
A systematic tool called the Infection Control Risk Assessment (ICRA) supports risk assessment:
- ICRA considers two factors in assessing risk:
- Population involved.
- Type of CRMD activity.
- Based on these factors, the ICRA matrix generates a list of one of 4 Categories of Preventative Measures.

# Infection Prevention and Control (IPAC) Measures

## Interdisciplinary Team (IDT)

The home should establish an IDT for the project, who determines the necessary preventive measures, and adjust them as needed. The IDT members, at minimum, include the following individuals:

- IPAC Home Lead/designate
- Administrator
- Director of Care/designate
- Maintenance Staff representative
- IPAC Lead/designate audits implemented measures daily.
- Environmental Services Manager
- Health & Safety Representative

Other optional members include corporate consultants (IPAC, Environmental, Engineering).

### Responsibilities

- Immediately address any deficiencies with corrective actions. Ensure that audit results are documented.
- Daily enhanced cleaning and disinfection of areas adjacent to the construction zone (as in high touch areas).
- Enhanced surveillance for atypical symptoms (e.g., atypical pneumonia, skin infections).

**Note:** Any reports of fungal infections or unexplained pneumonia must be immediately flagged and investigated further.

## Phases of Construction Risk Management (CRM)

1. Evaluate the project that needs to be completed, ensuring that the full scope of work is understood.
2. Inform all the appropriate stakeholders including the Regional Director and corporate consultants (as needed).
3. Form the IDT, who completes the Infection Control Risk Assessment (ICRA) and approves it.
4. Communicate the contents of the ICRA to the constructor and staff.
5. Implement all the preventive measures and inspect.

## Final Construction Clean

Upon completion of all CRM activities, the constructor must ensure that all the systems that were affected are functioning well. The constructor must also perform a final construction clean before handing the site over to the home (detergent + HEPA vacuuming).

# Final Construction Clean

Final construction clean means no visible debris or dust on any of the surfaces or in any areas (e.g., crevices, cabinets, etc.). Any barriers that were set up must also be cleaned with detergent and HEPA vacuumed before removal. The home does a final inspection and documents the results of the final clean.

## Terminal Clean & Occupancy

After completion of the final construction clean, the home’s housekeeping department does a terminal clean of the construction area. A terminal clean shall follow the policies in Housekeeping and Laundry. A terminal clean is similar to a discharge clean.

### Environmental Services

- Increase the frequency of cleaning in areas adjacent to the construction area while the project is underway.
- A terminal clean is required following the completion of the project before it is occupied.

## What Can You Do to Help?

### Nursing, Medical and Other Staff

- Assist IPAC in identifying high-risk patients who may require special prevention strategies.
- Report violations of construction-related infection control procedures to Facilities and to IPAC.
- Heighten surveillance on your unit for health care-associated infections (especially pneumonias and other respiratory infections) and report to the IPAC home lead.
- Work with Facilities and IPAC to identify areas that need to be damp mopped and clean these areas as scheduled.
- Thoroughly clean new and renovated areas before admitting patients. Wipe all horizontal surfaces with a hospital-approved disinfectant.
- Coordinate inspection of final cleaning with IPAC prior to opening/re-opening the area.

# Construction-Related Prevention Strategies

## Report any discoloration of water, evidence of leaks or any other areas of concern
- Includes, but is not limited to:
- Dust
- Debris
- Damage, etc.

Contact your IPAC home lead or manager with any questions or concerns.

### Traffic Control Patterns
Traffic patterns for construction workers and construction activities should be away from patient care areas. Cleaning schedules need to be increased in these areas.

### Dust Containment
To minimize dust generation and dispersal, barriers must be used to create a separation between the construction project site and non-construction areas. The type of barrier used will depend on the length of time it will be needed:

#### a) Long Term Projects (i.e., within a week)
Activities that generate a moderate to high level of dust, cause a moderate service disruption, require demolition, require removal of a fixed facility component (e.g., a sink) or assembly (e.g., a countertop or cupboard) and can be completed in a single week.

- **Barrier type:**
- Erect an impermeable dust barrier (hoarding), from the floor to the underside of the deck (including the areas above false ceilings) consisting of two layers of 6 mil fire-retardant polyethylene (or an equivalent barrier) and gypsum wallboard protection approved by the interdisciplinary team.
- The top and bottom of plastic barriers that reach from floor to ceiling shall be sealed off to isolate the construction area from adjacent areas.
- The dust barrier shall remain in place until the project is complete and the area has been cleaned thoroughly and inspected.
- After construction has been completed, the dust barrier shall be removed.

# Anteroom Construction and Short-Term Projects

## Anteroom Requirements
An anteroom shall be constructed for access to a site from within the building. Each access point shall have an anteroom.

- Place a walk-off mat outside and inside the anteroom to trap dust.
- The anteroom shall have a closable door.
- The bottom of the door should have rubber stripping or a brush attachment.
- A HEPA filtered vacuum cleaner must remain in the anteroom at all times to clean workers' clothing on exiting the site.

## Short Term Projects (< 2 hours)
Small-scale, short-duration (e.g., less than 2 hours) activities that create minimal dust. Includes, but is not limited to:

- Activities that require access to and use of chase spaces.
- Cutting a small opening in a contained space where dust mitigation can be controlled, e.g., cutting of walls or ceilings to provide an access point for installing or repairing minor electrical work, ventilation components, telephone wires, or computer cables.
- Sanding or repair of a small area of a wall.
- Plumbing work that disrupts the water supply of one or more resident care areas for less than 30 minutes or one fixture for 1 hour or more.

### Inspection and Non-Invasive Activities
Includes, but is not limited to:

- Activities that involve a single controlled opening in a wall or ceiling.

## Barrier Type
- Isolate the HVAC system in the area where work is being done to prevent contamination of the duct system.
- Minimize dust accumulation and the buildup of debris in the work area.
- Ensure that all construction debris is removed at the end of each day, at minimum.
- Erect an impermeable dust barrier, from the floor to the underside of the deck (including the areas above false ceilings) consisting of two layers of 0.15 mm (6 mil) fire-retardant poly plastic sheets.

### Air Exhaust Considerations
If construction air will be exhausted near resident windows and/or doors, then such windows and/or doors shall be closed.

### Barrier Management
- HEPA vacuum erected barriers and wipe with detergent before removal.
- Remove the barrier material carefully to minimize spreading of dirt and debris associated with construction (e.g., folding them towards the centre).
- Contain construction waste before transport in tightly covered containers.
- Remove or isolate HVAC system in areas where work is being performed.
- Repair holes in walls within 8 hours or seal them temporarily.
- Ensure that ventilation systems are working properly in adjacent areas.

### Long Term Construction
Activities that generate high levels of dust, necessitate significant service disruptions, and involve major demolition and construction activities requiring more than a single week to complete. Includes but is not limited to:
- Soil excavation
- New construction that requires consecutive work shifts to complete

### Environmental Cleaning
- Areas adjacent to the construction area must be kept clean and clear of debris.
- There must be frequent wet mopping or dust mopping.
- The construction area must also be cleaned daily, either by wet mopping or by HEPA-filtered vacuuming to keep the dust down. This may be done by construction personnel.

- **Effective Date:** [Insert Effective Date]
- **Review Date:** [Insert Review Date]

----

## Cleaning Procedures

When the construction is complete, the site must be thoroughly cleaned by the construction workers. The walls and all horizontal surfaces must be wet-wiped, and the floors must be wet mopped.

- **Dirt Removal:**
- Workers must remove dirt from their clothing and footwear before leaving the work area.
- A HEPA filtered vacuum may be used.

### Resident Areas

In resident’s areas, the workers must:
- Wear gowns, shoe covers, and head covers when walking through these areas.
- Alternatively, new clean overalls may be worn instead of a gown.

## Debris Removal

- Debris should be removed away from resident’s care areas.
- Debris should be removed in the evening when residents are in their rooms and visitors have left. If this is not possible, debris should be removed at the end of the workday by the construction workers.
- Debris should be in tightly covered containers or covered with moistened sheets before it is removed from the construction area or double bagged.
- Exposure of residents should be minimized as much as possible.
- Residents must be kept away from the construction area as much as possible.
- Otherwise, residents who must pass by construction areas must wear masks.

## Personal Protective Equipment

### Workers

- Workers should wear protective clothing, e.g., coveralls, when working in the construction zone because of the high concentration of dust.
- When the construction site is in a resident care area, workers must cover all sterile, packaged, and clean supplies that are located near areas under construction to reduce the risk of contamination.
- Used supplies and equipment should be enclosed in covered containers when being transported to prevent exposure.
