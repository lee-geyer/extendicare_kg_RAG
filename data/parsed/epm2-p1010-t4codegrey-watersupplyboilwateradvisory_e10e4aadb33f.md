### Drinking, Food Preparation and Teeth Brushing
- **Option 1:** Provide bottled water.
- **Option 2:** Boil tap water for at least 1 minute at a full rolling boil and allow to cool down before using. Water can be stored in jugs to be used at later times.

### Handwashing, Bathing and Showering
Unless informed otherwise by the local public health officials, it is safe to continue to wash your hands, bathe and shower during a boil water advisory.
- Ensure you scrub your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and then rinse them under running water.
- When bathing and showering ensure no water is swallowed or put into the mouth. If there is risk of water being swallowed, offer a bed bath/sponge bath instead.

### Dishwashing
- Use disposable dishes and utensils for ease.
- If disposable dishes are not used, the dishwashing machine can be used if the water reaches a rinse temperature of 180°F (82°C) or higher or it has a sanitizing cycle.
- For hand washing dishes there are 2 options:
- **Option 1:** Boil tap water for at least 1 minute at a full rolling boil and wait until it has cooled before putting your hands in.
- **Option 2:** Wash and rinse dishes as normal. In another sink mix 1 teaspoon of unscented household liquid bleach per 1 gallon of warm water (example, if the sink fits 3 gallons of water, mix in 3 teaspoons of bleach). Soak all washed and rinsed dishes in the bleach-water mixture for at least one minute. Place dishes in drying rack to air dry.

Laundry services can be conducted as usual.
