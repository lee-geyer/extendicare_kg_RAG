In addition, proper techniques reduce the risk of dysphagia and dysphagia-related complications, such as aspiration pneumonia.## Strategies for Assisting Residents with Eating### Proper Positioning- Ensure the resident is sitting in an upright position, as close to a 90-degree angle as possible. - Their back should be flat against the back of the chair and their spine should be in a neutral position with their shoulders in-line with their hips. This includes most residents who are sitting in wheelchairs (see below). - Ensure the resident’s feet and arms are supported which will increase their stability. Use additional support if necessary to promote proper positioning (e.g., pillows, towels, or blankets to support the head, neck, and trunk). - Ensure the resident’s head is as close to a 90-degree angle as possible. The head should not be tilted to the side or extended backwards.",

      "text": "- Ensure the resident’s head is as close to a 90-degree angle as possible. The head should not be tilted to the side or extended backwards. The chin should be tilted slightly downward towards the chest which protects the windpipe (called a chin-tuck). - If the resident has poor muscle tone and is pulled forward by gravity when they lean forward past the upright, 90-degree position, producing a chin tuck can be more difficult. However, a chin tuck can be produced while the person is sitting in a slightly reclined/tilted position (to avoid the impact of gravity) by supporting the shoulders and head. A neck pillow can provide support for the head and placing rolled hand towels or small pillows under the shoulders can help shoulder positioning. In this way, the pull of gravity is overcome and yet a chin tuck is produced (i.e., this is similar to the position that you would be in if you wanted to watch television while lying in bed). - Ensure the table is positioned at a suitable height (e.g., adjust the seat or the table). The resident should also be seated close to the table to ensure proper support, comfort, and ease with eating (e.g., reaching their food).",

The resident should also be seated close to the table to ensure proper support, comfort, and ease with eating (e.g., reaching their food). The resident’s food, utensils, and drink should be within their functional reach. - If a resident is sitting in a geri chair, tilt chair, air chair, etc., and cannot reach the table, ensure they have a lap tray or table available for their meal or that someone is able to assist them in eating. - If a resident is required to remain in bed for mealtime, raise the head of the bed as close to 90 degrees as tolerated and place supports behind the resident’s head and shoulders, so their head is positioned midline and at a 90-degree angle with a chin-tuck. - It is important to encourage the resident to remain in an upright position for at least 30 minutes after each meal.
