## POLICY
There will be an organized program of laundry service. The laundry program will maintain the processing of personal clothing and linen in a safe and timely manner that supports the quality of life for the residents and infection control needs of the home.

## STANDARD
- Chemicals will be dispensed, whenever possible, through a dispensing system that is calibrated for each chemical and purchased from Extendicare’s preferred vendors.
- Washers and dryers must be purchased from Extendicare’s pre-approved list.
- A labelling system for articles of clothing will be used from Extendicare’s pre-approved list.

- Laundry Department staff will follow a cleaning schedule regularly and as required.
- Dryer lint screens are kept clean to prevent fire and promote efficient drying time.

- All clean linen will be folded according to type. Linens will be handled carefully to reduce wrinkling, ensuring they look good when they arrive at the home area for resident use.
- All damaged, worn, or frayed linens will be removed from service, placed in a designated discard container, and recorded. Guidelines for annual inventory of linen are followed.
- All stained linen will be sent through a rewash cycle. If stains remain, the linen will be placed in a designated discard container and recorded.
- Linen quotas will be set for an adequate supply for residents and care staff.
- House linens will be delivered to the home areas on a daily basis, using either an exchange cart system or a linen top-up system.
- Residents’ personal clothing will be returned within 48 to 72 hours.
- All personal clothing will be documented, labelled, and returned to the resident labelled within 48 hours after it has been received by the home (unless resident refuses labelling).
- Services such as dry cleaning, mending, altering, and ironing of personal clothing must adhere to prevailing provincial legislation, guidelines, and standards.
- Staff will support family members’ requests to launder resident’s clothing at home.
- A team approach will be enacted to report and search for residents’ missing clothing.
