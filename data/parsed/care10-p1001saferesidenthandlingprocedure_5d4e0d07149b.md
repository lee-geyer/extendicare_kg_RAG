## POLICY

### Safe Resident Handling

## PROCEDURE

Staff will adhere to Extendicare’s established protocols for safe resident handling, including lifts, transfer, and repositioning according to the individualized assessed needs of all residents to minimize associated risk.

- An initial Safe Resident Handling Risk Assessment to determine the resident’s mobility, strength, and cognitive status will be conducted by a nurse on move-in, for the development of an individualized plan of care.
- Re-completion of the Safe Resident Handling Risk Assessment will be conducted when a change in functional status has been identified upon review of the interRAI assessment or other factors where the interdisciplinary team determines re-evaluation of the resident functional abilities may be required (i.e., increase in falls).
- Where additional comprehensive assessment(s) may be required to further determine functional abilities and the potential for adaptive or assistive devices, the nurse will refer to special rehabilitative services (i.e., physiotherapy, occupational therapy, allied health) as applicable.
- Individual goals will be established through collaboration between the interdisciplinary team, including restorative and special rehabilitation services (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, allied health, etc.) as applicable, to support the implementation of interventions aimed to maintain, improve, or prevent decline in transfer and repositioning abilities, and that optimize resident safety and independence.
- The resident’s assessed level of supervision and/or physical assistance will be indicated by use of transfer logos as per provincial regulatory and health authority requirements.
- Transfer logos will be visible in all resident rooms indicating one or more of the following levels of assistance based on assessed need:
- Independent transfer
- Supervised transfer
- One person transfer
- Two person transfer
- Sit to Stand lift
- Mechanical lift (floor & ceiling)
- All lifts and transfers will be performed as per the plan of care and transfer logos unless increased supports are otherwise required based on identified risk prior to initiating transfer.
