## EVACUATION PROCEDURES
1. Staff members will be designated to be on the outer side of the fire doors taking received residents, or to go room to room evacuating residents. Try to have the same number of people receiving residents at the fire door as teams evacuating residents from rooms (for example, if you have 9 staff members, 3 will receive residents at the fire doors and 6 will be broken into teams to evacuate rooms).
2. All staff who are going room to room must be in teams of two. Teams enter rooms and bring resident(s) to the closest fire doors.
3. Staff waiting on the other side of fire doors take the residents to safety.
4. After a team has confirmed there are no residents in a room, they close the door and flag the room as empty.
5. Steps 1-3 continue until all the residents in the affected area have been evacuated.
