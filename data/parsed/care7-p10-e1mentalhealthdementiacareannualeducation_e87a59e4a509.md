# Dementia Care & Behavioural Supports

## Key Definitions

- **Behavioural Supports**
Refers to a comprehensive set of assessments and care planning designed to support residents experiencing or at risk of responsive behaviours.

- **Responsive behaviours**
Refer to actions, words, or gestures that may arise as expressions of unmet needs, discomfort, or distress. These behaviours are often a response to the person’s environment, interactions, or underlying medical or psychological conditions.

- **What might we see with responsive behaviours?**
- **Physical and verbal agitation/restlessness:** Can stem from physical discomfort, emotional distress, or environmental triggers.
- **Verbal outbursts:** Often signal frustration, fear, or the need for attention.
- **Wandering:** May reflect boredom, confusion, or a desire for familiar spaces.

**Key insight:** Responsive behaviours are not deliberate, and every behaviour has meaning.
