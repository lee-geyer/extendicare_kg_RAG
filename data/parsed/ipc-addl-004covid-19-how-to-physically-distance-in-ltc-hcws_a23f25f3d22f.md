## HOW TO PHYSICALLY DISTANCE

Physical distancing prevents droplets from an infected person from being spread into the environment and onto people within 2 metres (or 6 feet) distance.

- Limiting the amount of people in the break room helps us ensure we can physically distance.
- I keep my distance from coworkers during my break, especially since I remove my mask to eat my lunch.
- I keep my distance when waiting in line for screening.
- We don't gather at the nursing station.
