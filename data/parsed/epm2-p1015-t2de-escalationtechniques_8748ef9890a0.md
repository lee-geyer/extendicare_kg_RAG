## De-escalation Techniques

1. **One person to take control of situation**
- Only one person should be managing an escalated situation with backup as needed. One person should take the lead for communication. Another person should be available to remove the speaking staff member from any direct contact as needed but should remain silent. Too many people talking can further agitate and confuse the aggressive individual.

2. **Apologize**
- Even if you had no control over the situation, apologize for their experience. Be sincere. This will often diffuse a situation.

3. **Empathize - Try to Understand their feelings**
- It is likely that this situation is about their feelings, even if they are unable to vocalize them. Try to identify their feelings through the words, actions, and expressions they are portraying to better understand what they are going through.

4. **Listen and do not be Judgmental**
- Do not dismiss or judge what the individual may say; listen to their concerns and understand that their thoughts and feelings are real.

5. **Stay out of their personal space**
- People often get upset or overwhelmed by others being too close to them; they may also feel threatened thinking you may use physical force.

6. **Have an escape route**
- Know your exits and be prepared to leave if the situation escalates.

7. **Do not use threatening words or gestures**
- Keep the tone of your voice calm, be mindful of what expressions are on your face, don’t move quickly or abruptly. Avoid negative and aggressive words such as swear words and words with negative meanings.

8. **Don’t get emotional**
- Remain calm and in control of yourself.

9. **Do not give in to challenges and challenging questions**
- Answering challenging questions is likely to be detrimental to the de-escalation. Responses can agitate the individual further or show them that they can obtain authority over you. Attempt to redirect them by offering to help and offering solutions to the problem at hand.

# De-escalation Techniques

- **Give them time to think and make decisions.**
People are less comfortable when they have to make quick decisions without the time to think it over. Give them the time to think about what they want, think about what you have said and make an informed non-rushed decision. Allow them to express their feelings and validate those feelings. Follow these preferred ways of approaching residents with responsive behaviours related to dementia such as:

- **Know your resident.**
Know what triggers the behaviour of the resident and if there is an option to remove those triggers to de-escalate the situation. Use what you know about the resident to try and engage them.

- **Remove any bystanders if possible and give the resident space.**
Allow the resident the space to de-escalate on their own, do not crowd them.

- **Remain calm.**
Speak to the resident with a calm, soothing voice.

- **Offer support from a distance if the resident is being physically responsive.**
Stay away from the resident so they cannot cause harm to you or themselves. Offer verbal support.

- **Don’t touch the resident.**
Placing your hands on someone should only be used as a last resort and only if you are trained in a behavior support program such as GPA. Remove those in danger vs trying to physically handle the situation.

- **Know your surroundings.**
Know your exit points if the situation escalates. Don’t back yourself into a corner.

- **Use close relationships.**
If it is safe to do so, have someone well known and close to the resident attempt to engage them, call their name and try to divert their attention.

- **Only one person should be communicating with the resident.**
Multiple people trying to communicate with the resident may confuse and overwhelm them. Support staff should remain close in case intervention is needed (e.g., to call 911).

- **If the resident starts to calm down, try to lead them to a place of safety.**
This allows them to have the appropriate time and space to calm down without unnecessary distractions or triggers. Offer them support and medicate as ordered.
