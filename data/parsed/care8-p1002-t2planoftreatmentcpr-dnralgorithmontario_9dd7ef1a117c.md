**Algorithm for Development of a Plan of Treatment related to CPR and Completion of the DNR Confirmation Form**
**Revised August 2010**

----

## Steps for Treatment Decision

### Step 1
**Cardiac arrest is possible due to:**
- a progressive life limiting disease process
- a high risk procedure
- advanced age.

### Step 2
**Is the person capable with respect to CPR treatment decision?**
- **Yes**
- **Step 5(a)**
- Obtain informed consent for CPR or no CPR
- If Substitute Decision Makers (SDM) cannot agree, see the plan of treatment.
- CPR will be included in Health Care Record (Plan of Treatment for CPR).
- Communicate plan to the care team.
- Encourage person if capable or SDM if incapable to share the plan of treatment with all family stakeholders/informal caregivers.

- **Step 5(a)(i)**
- Document decision on Health Care Record (Plan of Treatment for CPR).
- Review entire process when health status changes significantly or at regular intervals.

- **No**
- **Step 3**
- Start the process of Conflict Resolution (reverse side).

### Step 4
**Determine care team members to be included in the discussion related to CPR.**

### Step 5
**Is CPR being offered as a treatment option by the physician?**
- **Yes**
- **Step 5(b)**
- Ensure the person/SDM(s) understands why CPR is not being offered as a treatment option.
- Has consensus been obtained?
- **No**
- Start the process of Conflict Resolution (reverse side).

- **No**
- **Step 5(b)(i)**
- Document decision on Health Care Record (Plan of Treatment for CPR).
- Complete DNR Confirmation Form.
- Communicate plan to the care team.

## Capacity to Consent

### Hierarchy of Substitute Decision Makers (SDM)
- Guardian of the person
- Attorney in a POAPC with authority for treatment/admission decision making
- Representative appointed by the Consent and Capacity Board
- Spouse or partner
- Parent or child or Children’s Aid Society
- Parent with Right of Access
- Brother or sister
- Any other relative by blood, marriage or adoption
- Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee

### CPR Discussion
**Guiding Principles**
- CPR is not considered to be an appropriate treatment option for:
- Untreatable malignancy
- End stage cardio respiratory disease
- End stage neurological disease
- Recent catastrophic cerebrovascular event
- Overwhelming sepsis unresponsive to treatment
- Severe metabolic abnormality unresponsive to treatment.

### Elements of Consent
- The consent must:
- relate to the treatment
- be informed
- be given voluntarily
- not be obtained through misrepresentation or fraud

### DNR Confirmation Form
- Belongs to person/client
- Following completion, copies may be made and distributed
- Form to be provided to:
1. Paramedics/firefighters when:
- 911 is called
- transported by ambulance
2. Other care team members.

----

## Informed Consent
Informed consent means that:
- (a) The person received information that a reasonable person in the same circumstances would require in order to make a decision about the treatment with respect to the nature of the treatment, expected benefits, material risks, material side effects, alternative courses of action and likely consequences of not having the treatment.
- (b) The person received responses to his or her requests for additional information.

See H on reverse side for discussion points for obtaining informed consent for CPR.

# Algorithm for Conflict Resolution Regarding CPR Decision

## Return to Algorithm Step 5(a)(ii).

### Yes
1. Convene a team family conference with a skilled neutral person as chair.
- Do all parties agree that CPR will not be included in the plan of treatment?
- **Yes**
- Physician decides whether to:
a) offer CPR as a treatment option in light of the goals, values, beliefs expressed by the person or SDM
b) transfer care of the person to another physician willing to offer CPR
c) with documented second physician opinion and agreement from the interdisciplinary team write a DNR order
d) refer to the Consent and Capacity Board (Application Form G)
e) refer to the courts.
- **No**
- Consider the need for a second medical opinion, a palliative care team consultation, and/or ethical/legal consultation.
- Document details of conflict and plan of action for conflict resolution on the health care record.
- Explain the conflict resolution process to all parties. Acknowledge a hope for voluntary resolution. Clearly state that ultimately it is the physician’s professional responsibility to determine which medical treatments he or she deems appropriate to offer.
- Negotiate the ground rules (time frames, respectful shared dialogue to explore the underlying meaning that supports the positions held by each party).
- Bring new expert opinions to the table.
- Share what the cardiac arrest event may look like with CPR and without CPR in the particular situation.

### Have 2 or more equally Ranked SDMs come to a unanimous agreement?
- **Yes**
- Return to Algorithm Step 5(a)(i) or Step 5(a)(ii).
- **No**
- Contact the office of the Public Guardian and Trustee (Treatment Decision Unit)
- London: (Mon-Fri) 1-800-891-0504, ext. 2002 or 1-519-660-3145
- Toronto: Urgent weekends and stat holidays only 1-800-387-2127.

## Physician Assessment Related to CPR

### CPR Discussion Points when CPR is being offered as a treatment option
1. Explain that the goal is to respect the person’s informed choice and to provide accurate information and appropriate care at all times during the person’s illness and to support the family.
2. Discuss the person’s unique values and goals/medical condition.
3. Explain that:
- CPR is an aggressive procedure which can work well in cases where the person is fairly healthy.
- CPR can be successful when the person’s heart suddenly stops beating normally and a health care provider or someone trained in CPR is on hand to begin CPR immediately. Studies have shown that only about 12 out of every 100 patients who receive CPR while in the hospital live through the procedure and are able to go home. Only 1-4% of persons with chronic illness will survive.
- Those whose hearts stop outside of hospital have a significantly lower chance of survival. The benefits of CPR are virtually zero for those who suffer unwitnessed heart stoppage (no one trained in CPR present when the heart stops).
- CPR will not help those who are at the natural end of their lives due to a progressive life limiting illness.
4. Discuss the:
- **Benefits:**
- In optimal circumstances CPR can save life.
- **Risks:**
- After 5 minutes without a heartbeat, serious brain and organ damage takes place which can leave the person in a state of pain and dependent on machines which breathe for the person. Breathing machines require a tube about the size of one's thumb to be placed into the person's airway. Tubes in the airway prevent the person from being able to talk while the machine is breathing for him or her. Depending on the severity of the brain damage, the machine for breathing may not be able to be removed.
- **Possible side effects:**
- Broken ribs
- Punctured lung
- Pain from trauma to chest
- **Alternative courses of action:**
- Excellent care and appropriate medical interventions that respect the person’s goals related to comfort, prolonging life, and which address physical, emotional and spiritual needs will be offered.
- **Consequences of not having CPR:**
- Palliative support will be given as natural death occurs.
5. Answer any questions.
6. Discuss the Physician Assessment related to CPR (Box G).

### CPR Discussion Points when CPR is not being offered as a treatment option
1. Follow Steps 1 to 6 in Box H.
2. Inform the person/SDM that because CPR would not be beneficial and could actually cause harm. Explain that the physician is recommending that CPR not be included in the plan of treatment.
3. Answer any further questions but do not continue to press your points.
4. If the person/SDM agrees with the physician’s recommendation/decision, refer to Algorithm Step 5(a)(ii).
5. If the person/SDM does not agree with the physician’s recommendation/decision, refer to Algorithm for Conflict Resolution.
