# Root Cause Analysis Guidelines

## Purpose
To provide a structured approach for conducting root cause analysis (RCA) in order to improve systems and processes.

## Scope
This document applies to all staff involved in the RCA process within Extendicare (Canada) Inc.

## Responsibilities
- **Committee**:
- a. Provide updates to regional or head office supports if they were previously engaged in the RCA.
- b. Identify ways to share lessons learned with key stakeholders.

## Effective Root Cause Analysis
To be most effective, the root cause analysis should:
- Focus primarily on systems and processes, not on individual performance.
- Repeatedly dig deeper by asking “Why?” and “Why?” again and again, until further reasons are exhausted.
- Identify human and other factors most directly associated with the event and the process(es) and systems related to its occurrence.
- Identify changes that could be made in systems and processes that would reduce the risk of such events occurring in the future.
- Include consideration of any relevant best practice or lessons learned from previous incidents.
