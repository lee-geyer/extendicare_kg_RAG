### Respond

#### Stage 1: Staff Who Identified the Resident as Missing; begin search, notify charge nurse.

- [ ] Record the time the resident was first identified as missing. ________
- [ ] Search the resident’s living area and areas in the home the resident is known to go. Ask nearby staff members and volunteers to help search.
- [ ] Check the leave of absence book, visitors’ log, and ask other staff and residents if they have seen the resident.
- [ ] Check external sitting areas.
- [ ] When resident has been missing for 5 minutes, notify the Charge Nurse/Incident Manager (even if the search is not complete). Charge Nurse will notify the Incident Manager or will become the Incident Manager until relieved by a more senior staff member.
- [ ] Follow instructions from the Incident Manager and continue to search.

#### Stage 2: Once Code Yellow is announced, report to the area designated as the Emergency Operations Centre and seek instruction for searching remainder of home and grounds.

- [ ] One staff member, at minimum, must remain in each resident home area and program area to maintain the safety and security of other residents.
- [ ] Upon hearing a resident is missing, notify the Incident Manager if you have seen them in your area of work.
- [ ] Search the home area assigned to you by the Incident Manager. Look in resident rooms, under beds, in closets, bathrooms, lounges, stairwells, utility rooms, staff rooms, storage rooms, shower rooms, etc.
- If you are provided with a floor plan or map, identify areas you have searched with an “X” on the map.
- If you are designated as the “team leader” for the area, you must report to the Incident Manager every 10 minutes (phone, walkie-talkie or in person).
- [ ] Search external sitting areas around the home.
- [ ] If an external area is assigned to you to search, always search with a partner. Search the neighbourhood in the direction assigned to you within a four-block radius. Conduct the external search in a vehicle, not on foot. If a map of the area is provided to you, identify areas you have searched with an “X” on the map. Trained search teams from emergency services will do a more thorough ground search.
- If you are aware of an external area the resident is known to frequent and it is within your assigned external search perimeter, notify the Incident Manager and check this area. If it is not within your assigned perimeter, notify the Incident Manager and they will notify the individual assigned to that perimeter.
- Report to the Incident Manager every 10 minutes (phone or in person).
