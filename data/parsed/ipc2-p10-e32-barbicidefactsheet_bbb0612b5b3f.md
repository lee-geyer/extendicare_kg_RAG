## Barbicide Fact Sheet

Barbicide is a clear blue solution often used to disinfect hairdressing and barbering equipment such as combs, brushes, and scissors. Health Canada categorizes a quaternary ammonium product as a low-level disinfectant.

### Proper uses of Barbicide:

1. **Clean tools before using Barbicide:**
- A dirty tool cannot be properly disinfected. Placing a soiled item (e.g., comb with hair strands) in a container filled with Barbicide will not disinfect the item; it will only contaminate the solution, and all other items placed in it.
- All tools must be thoroughly cleaned with soap/detergent, scrubbed with a brush, then rinsed with potable water before placing them in the Barbicide solution.

2. **Put Barbicide by the sink:**
- Put the Barbicide container next to the sink rather than the workstation. This will make it easier to wash items first before disinfecting with Barbicide.

3. **Follow instructions:**
- Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions about:
- Proper dilution.
- How often it needs to be changed.
- The amount of time the disinfectant must remain wet on the surface of the instrument.

4. **Check expiry date:**
- Check the expiry date of the Barbicide to ensure the product has not expired.
