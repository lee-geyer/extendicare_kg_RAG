### Instructions
This form is to be used by facilities for the mandatory report to coroner required when a person dies while a resident in a long-term care (LTC) home (Coroners Act, Section 10(2.1)).

For the purposes of this reporting requirement, a person is considered a resident in a long-term care home for the duration of their admission, including within 30 days of transfer to hospital. If the resident died in hospital, complete this form based upon their condition when they left the LTC home.

This form must be submitted online.

- **Part 1** is to be completed by registered staff of the long-term care home on the day of death or as soon as the home receives notice of the death from the hospital. It is to be submitted to the Office of the Chief Coroner (OCCF) immediately upon completion by using the "Submit Part 1" button. The person completing Part 1 will receive a confirmation email including the Part 1 Submission Reference Number. This number, along with the form, should then be forwarded to the Director of Nursing and Personal Care or the Administrator of the long-term care home.

- **Part 2** is to be completed by the Director of Nursing and Personal Care or the Administrator of the long-term care home in consultation with other staff as necessary. It is to be submitted by using the "Submit Part 2" button. It should be submitted within 7 days of the death (or within 5 days of receiving notice of the death from the hospital).

Fields marked with an asterisk (*) are mandatory.
