      "text": "# The Palliative Pain & Symptom Management Program## Feeding the DyingThere are definite advantages to little or no food intake as death approaches. This is nature’s way of leading to a peaceful death.### There Are Benefits To Not EatingAs fluid/food intake is reduced, the tissues become dryer and shrink. This means that if there is a tumor present, there is less pressure on/from the tumor. The tumor itself may become smaller. The need for pain medication may also be less.- **Swelling** of the feet, legs, and other tissues will be reduced. - If fluid has accumulated in the abdomen, comfort will be promoted as there will be less pressure on the organs; breathing may also be easier. - **Urine Output** will go down; meaning that less energy will be used going to the bathroom. If bladder control is a problem, it means less incontinence and a greater sense of dignity. - **Lung Secretions** will be less, resulting in less congestion and easier, more comfortable breathing.### It’s A Natural ProcessNot eating is a normal part of dying.",

You may feel conflict between yourself and your loved one if your efforts to encourage eating are not successful. You may also feel conflict with the staff if their efforts are not successful. You may be losing your sense of hope as you see your loved one slipping away and leaving you powerless to stop it. You may fear that your loved one will be abandoned.### Considerations- Is the dying person able to make his/her own decisions? - If not, does anyone have Power of Attorney for personal care?",

There are valid reasons for this. In our society, we see food as a basic necessity of life. We equate it with love. We view a good appetite as a sign of good health. Most of our social functions involve eating or drinking. You are likely to feel guilty and helpless because you are not providing a basic necessity. You may be afraid that others will see you as uncaring.## Is There Anything You Can Do?While there are not any easy answers, you may find the following helpful:- Avoid conflict by supporting your loved one’s decision (no matter what it is). - Discuss your feelings with others. - Try and make your remaining time with your loved one meaningful by:\n- Talking\n- Holding hands\n- Being there for them\n- Looking at photo albums\n- Giving back rubs\n- Playing cards\n- Reminiscing, etc.This will provide quality time for you and will show that you care.",
