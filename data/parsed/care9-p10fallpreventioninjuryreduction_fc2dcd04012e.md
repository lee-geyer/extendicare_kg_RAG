## POLICY

Extendicare is committed to providing a Fall Prevention and Injury Reduction Program to reduce the incidence of resident falls and fall-related injuries. An interdisciplinary team approach, based on clinical best practices and in keeping with the standards set by provincial and regional health and regulatory authorities, is used.

### STANDARD

Protocols for fall prevention and injury reduction are established through consultation with the interdisciplinary team and restorative committees to minimize the risk of injury, maintain resident dignity, and promote optimal independence in daily living.

- Upon move-in, and as needed, an Integrated Fall Risk Assessment will be completed by the nurse to support the development of an individualized plan of care and updated as needed with the active engagement of the resident/SDM/POA.
- Universal Fall Prevention Strategies will be used across the home for resident safety. Additional fall prevention strategies to reduce or mitigate falls for high-risk residents will be implemented to meet the needs of each individual resident.
- A Falling Star Logo will be placed in a standardized location to represent the resident’s high fall risk level, or upon clinical judgement.
- If a resident falls, alternate strategies may be trialed and/or implemented to prevent further falls and reduce the risk of a fall-related injury.
- Resident safety and independence will be supported through the implementation of restorative care approaches, use of equipment, supplies, assistive devices, and referrals as appropriate.
- All medical equipment and devices to support fall prevention and injury reduction will be utilized, maintained, and stored according to the manufacturer’s instructions in conjunction with Extendicare’s policies and procedures.
- A nurse in the home will serve as the Fall Prevention Lead, overseeing the program.
- The Fall Prevention Lead will meet monthly with the interdisciplinary team, including restorative care and special rehabilitation services (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, allied health, etc.) to discuss opportunities for fall prevention and injury reduction strategies, ensure compliance with standards set out in policy and procedure, and complete an annual program evaluation related to fall prevention and injury reduction.
