## Code Silver
### Active Assailant Emergency Response Action Plan

#### Staff Member Discovering the Incident
Recognizes or becomes aware of an incident in which a weapon (firearm, edged weapon, explosive device, or instrument that can cause bodily harm or injury) is being used by an individual(s) actively engaged in killing, or attempting to kill, people.

#### RUN
- Have an escape route and plan in mind
- If you are with a resident, see **Code Silver Resident Care Decisions**
- Leave the area of the threat immediately; leave your belongings behind
- Do not wait for others to follow and do not stop to assist anyone injured by the assailant. If an injured person is ambulatory and will not delay your escape, have them travel with you away from the building
- Choose a safe exit to leave the facility
- Call 911 when it is safe to do so

#### HIDE
Depending on the situation/where you are, your best option may be to:
- Get out of the assailant’s view
- Block entry to your hiding place; close and secure doors. As able, cover any door windows, barricade the door with beds, desks, supply carts, heavy furniture
- Turn out the room lights. The room must seem to be empty.
- Stay quiet; silence your pager and cell phone; turn off any source of noise (e.g. radio, TV)
- If safe and able, particularly if there are injured individuals with you, call 911 (cell or landline) to report where occupants or the assailants are sheltering. Do what you can to help any injured individuals who are sheltering with you
- Remain where you are until Police announce themselves and they open the door to allow you out

#### FIGHT
If RUN or HIDE are not safe options, when your life is in imminent danger; prepare to:
- FIGHT
- As a last resort and only when your life is in imminent danger
- Attempt to incapacitate the assailant
- Act with physical aggression. If with others, act as a team; use improvised weapons (e.g. fire extinguishers, scissors, chairs)
