### INFORMATION ABOUT TUBERCULOSIS TESTING (please read before signing)

Tuberculosis testing is a simple procedure whereby a Registered Staff injects a small amount of serum under the skin in one forearm. Side effects of this test are rare. You need to come back to see the Nurse in 2-4 days to have your arm observed for the presence or absence of a reaction to the test. You may have no reaction to the test; thus, you have a negative TB result, and you need to have the second step of the testing completed. Alternately, you may have a reaction that results in a raised red area that may range in size from 0.5 mm up to 10 mm. Depending on the size of the red area you may be referred to your physician for further assessment as this would be a positive TB test. A positive TB test does not mean you have TB; that is why it is important to follow up with your physician.

- I have read the above, have had an opportunity to ask any questions and understand the material and any responses to my questions.
- I have had a TB test in the past.
- I have not had a positive reaction to a TB test in the past.
- I consent to be observed for 15 minutes after administration of each step of the test.

**NOTE:** If the staff has had a positive reaction refer the person to their primary health care practitioner.
