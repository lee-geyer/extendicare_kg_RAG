## POLICY
### Fall Prevention and Injury Reduction

## PROCEDURE
- Upon move-in, a nurse will conduct an Integrated Fall Risk Assessment to determine the resident’s fall risk status, including risk factors, to support the development of an individualized plan of care.
- The Integrated Fall Risk Assessment will be reviewed and/or completed to identify changes in fall-risk level with:
- A significant change in status that may impact fall-risk factors (i.e., multiple falls, changes in mobility status).
- InterRAI care planning triggers (i.e., falls CAP).
- Individual goals will be established through collaboration between the interdisciplinary team, including restorative and special rehabilitation services (allied health, PT, OT, etc.) as applicable, with resident/SDM/POA engagement to support the implementation of interventions aimed to maintain, improve, or prevent decline in abilities, and that optimize resident safety and independence.
- Prevention strategies to reduce or mitigate falls for high-risk residents will be trialed, implemented and/or removed as needed, and intervention will be documented on the residents individualized plan of care.
- For residents deemed at high risk of falls and/or upon clinical judgment, a Falling Star Logo will be placed in a standardized location in the home to indicate the resident’s fall risk level.
- Where additional comprehensive assessment(s) may be required to further determine functional abilities and the potential adaptive or assistive devices for fall prevention or reduction, the nurse will refer to special rehabilitative services as applicable.
