# How to Wear a Face Mask the Safe and Smart Way!

## The Right Way
- Make sure your mask completely covers your nose and mouth and is secured snugly under your chin.
- Wash your hands before you put on, and after you take off, your mask.
- Touch only the ties or ear loops when putting on or taking off your mask.
- If your mask has a metal wire running along the top edge, mold it over the bridge of your nose to help contain droplets.
- Dispose of the mask when it becomes damaged, soiled, or contaminated with body fluids (droplets/secretions).
- Store masks in a clean environment.

## The Wrong Way
- Don’t touch the outside of your mask while you are wearing it.
- Don’t lower your mask so you can talk.
- Don’t wear a mask that’s too loose or slides down your face.
- Don’t rest your mask around your neck or under your chin.
- Don’t hang your mask off your ear.
- Don’t double-mask (wear one mask on top of another).

> When worn properly, a mask is an important way to prevent the spread of infection.

# Respiratory Etiquette

## Coughing & Sneezing Best Practices

### Move it
Move away from others when you feel a sneeze or cough coming on.

### Catch it
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you sneeze or cough. If you don’t have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your sleeve or elbow, not into your hands!

### Bin it
Discard any used tissue in a garbage bin.

### Kill it
Wash or sanitize hands immediately. Remember to rub hands for a minimum of 15 seconds!

----

## Stop the Spread of Infection
Infections (such as influenza, COVID-19, cold viruses, and even whooping cough) are spread by coughing or sneezing. When you cough or sneeze on your hands, your hands carry and spread these infectious agents. When you touch an object such as a door handle, elevator button, telephone, or computer keyboard with unclean hands, you are spreading germs. The next person who touches these objects may pick up these germs and get sick if they do not clean their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
