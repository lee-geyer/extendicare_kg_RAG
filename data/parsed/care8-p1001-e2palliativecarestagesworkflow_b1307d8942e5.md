# Extendicare Palliative Care Stages Workflow

**NOTE:** Each Palliative Stage encompasses all actions from the previous stages.

- **Palliative Approach to Care** starts with identifying the resident's needs on move-in (before 6 week care conference).
- Complete UDA - Palliative Assessment & My Care, My Voice Summary in PCC, which includes the completion of the PPS and CHESS assessments.

## Stage 1 - Stable
**PPS 70%-100%**
- Discussion initiated with resident/SDM about ACP - Goals of Care.
- Initiate resident's Plan of Care based on resident wishes and advanced care planning.
- Review CHESS scores quarterly and complete Palliative Assessment if any change in score.
- Identify the need by using recommended assessment tools to assess resident's change/decline in health status.
- Complete PPS quarterly if score > 40.

## Stage 2 - Transitional
**PPS 40%-60%**
- Communicate results of PPS/CHESS score to Palliative Lead/Interdisciplinary/Resident/SDM and physician.
- Educate Resident/SDM on these changes.
- Update the resident Plan of Care as changes occur.
- Identify and manage physical and emotional symptoms.
- Collaborate with resident/SDM to review/update the plan of care with interventions which include:
- Pain/symptom management
- Nutritional needs
- Skin integrity needs (i.e., pressure relief surface)
- Spiritual/religious/cultural needs
- Review of ACP - Goals of Care
- Complete interRAI assessment "Significant Change in Status" indicating resident has changed to End-of-Life which is indicated in the section Health Conditions.
- Recommendation that if the PPS score is 30%, complete PPS weekly; if PPS score is 20%, complete daily; PPS 10% completed once per shift.
- Review and update the resident Plan of Care and review all the areas mentioned in the Transitional Stage along with After Death Care (funeral arrangements, organ donation, etc.).
- Communicate end-of-life status (staff/family/physician).

## Stage 3 - End-of-Life
**PPS 10%-30%**
- Discuss with Physician/NP End of Life Orders.
- Provide Comfort Care Rounds: Turn and position, Mouth care.
- Prepare resident/family for likely signs and symptoms of deterioration they may experience/witness during final days.
- Share the "Nearing the End of Life" brochure with family.
- Once resident death appears imminent, you may want to consider the following:
- Discontinuation of oral medications when unable to swallow.
- Insert butterfly as needed for SC medications as ordered.
- Discontinue vital sign monitoring.
- Decrease aggressive bowel care.
- Consider discontinuing oxygen therapy as it is not providing any benefit unless required for severe dyspnea (continue if family appears distressed by that process).
- Nurse to assign POC-Task End of Life for care staff to follow.
- Assist family with grief, loss, and bereavement at end-of-life.
