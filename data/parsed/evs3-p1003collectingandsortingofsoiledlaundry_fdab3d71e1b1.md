## POLICY

### Personal Clothing and Linen Processes

## PROCEDURE

### Manager or Designate:

Design and document a system to be used in home areas for the collection and sorting of linens. Consider including:

1. **4-bag hampers for linens** with corresponding colour-coded bags for use in the nursing home areas. For example:
- **White** – sheets/pillowcases
- **Blue** – towels
- **Green** – comforters
- **Orange** – personal clothing

2. **Another 2-bag hamper system** may be considered for the disposal of soiled incontinence products, along with a coloured collection bag for bed pads, if used, and peri cloths.

3. **Dining room:** 2-bag system; one bag for the collection of table linens and a separate bag for the collection of protective garments.

4. **Spas/shower rooms:** 2-bag system; one for the collection of towels and a separate bag for personal clothing.

Ensure sufficient numbers of coloured laundry bags and hamper stands for each linen/clothing item are available to support and reinforce the proper sorting system. All bags should have a drawstring and closure.

Post signs on lids of hampers to indicate coloured bag and item description.

In conjunction with the Director of Care/designate, educate care staff on the proper sorting procedure in the home areas.

Visually monitor the collection process to ensure best practices are followed to minimize and/or eliminate handling and sorting in the Laundry Department and to support good infection control practices.

# PROCEDURE

## SECTION: Personal Clothing and Linen Processes - Laundry
### DESCRIPTION: Collecting and Sorting Soiled Laundry
### INDEX: EVS3-P10.03

### Care Staff (Healthcare Aides, Nursing Assistants, Personal Support Workers, Continuing Care Assistants, and Care Aides):
- Equip the soiled linen hampers with the correct coloured bag according to the colour coding system and place each type of soiled linen in the corresponding soiled linen bag.
- Fill linen bags only ½ to ¾ full for ease of handling and safe lifting.

#### Personal clothing:
- Check pockets for glasses, wallets, combs, dentures, etc. before depositing in personal laundry bag.
- Check to make sure items are washable. Non-washable items are to be given to the family to be cleaned unless other arrangements have been made.

- Remove laundry bags containing soiled linen after each round, or more often if needed, to support infection control and reduce odours. Pull the bag closed using the drawstring and closure.
- Remove gross soil such as faeces and dispose into toilet or hopper. Do not remove excrement by spraying with water. Transport soiled items to the soiled utility room and rinse as required. During transport, fold the linen inwards to contain heavy soil. Place rinsed item in appropriate hamper. Make sure you wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and thoroughly clean your hands after handling soiled linen.

#### External
- In some provinces (such as Manitoba), public health directives permit only the dumping of solid waste. In these provinces, do not rinse soiled linen on the home area. Deposit heavily soiled linen into the appropriate bags.
- Deliver or send laundry to the laundry frequently during your shift. This will ensure that the Laundry Department operates continually, and the risk of odours is reduced.
- Notify the Manager or designate if there is a shortage of bags for collection of linens or if bags are being received in the home areas without drawstrings.
