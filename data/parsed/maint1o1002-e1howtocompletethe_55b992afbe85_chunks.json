They have been prepared as an easy way to list the routine preventive maintenance activities to be performed regularly. Facilities that use a computerized system can import the information from these checklists into the work orders of the automated system. - Since checklists have been prepared for the equipment found in many different facilities, some of the listed equipment is mutually exclusive; not all of the equipment found in the checklists will be found at every home. Each home should review the list of equipment and select the checklists that correspond to the equipment found at that home. These checklists should be separate from those that are not applicable. - It is recommended that checklists applicable to the home be kept blank and copied annually so that maintenance staff can record their maintenance records for the year on the copy of the checklist that applies to that year.",

The description of the equipment or room should be written at the top of the list, for example, on the Equipment Name is listed as “Make-Up Air Unit”. The location that this unit serves should be added (even if it is done in pencil or ink) so that the Equipment Name would now read “Make Up Air Unit: West Wing”. > **Note:** If there are several make-up air units, a separate checklist would be created for each unit.2.
