# Six Steps to Wearing the N95 Respirator

## Step 1
Wash your hands thoroughly before putting on the respirator.

## Step 2
Use an N95 respirator that has been fit-tested for you.

## Step 3
Hold the respirator in your hand and place it firmly over your nose, mouth, and chin.

## Step 4
First, stretch and position the bottom band under your ears. Then, stretch and position the top band high at the back of your head.

## Step 5
Press the thin metal wire along the upper edge gently against the bridge of your nose so that the respirator fits snugly on your face.

## Step 6
Perform a fit check by breathing in and out. While breathing out, check for air leakage around your face.
