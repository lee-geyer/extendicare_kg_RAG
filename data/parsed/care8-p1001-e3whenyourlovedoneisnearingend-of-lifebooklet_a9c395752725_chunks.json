      "text": "# When a Loved One is Nearing the End## What to Expect in the Final Days### Overview\nIn the final days of a loved one's life, it is common to experience a range of emotions and changes. Understanding what to expect can help you provide comfort and support.### Physical Changes\n- **Decreased Appetite**: It is normal for individuals to eat and drink less. - **Increased Sleep**: Many people will spend more time sleeping or in a semi-conscious state. - **Changes in Breathing**: Breathing patterns may change, including periods of rapid breaths followed by pauses.### Emotional and Psychological Changes\n- **Withdrawal**: Your loved one may become less communicative and more withdrawn. - **Confusion**: They may experience confusion or disorientation. - **Emotional Fluctuations**: Expect a range of emotions, including fear, sadness, and acceptance.### Providing Comfort\n- **Be Present**: Simply being there can provide immense comfort. - **Speak Softly**: Use a calm and soothing voice. - **Physical Touch**: Holding their hand or gentle touch can be reassuring.### Support for Caregivers\n- **Take Breaks**: Caregiving can be exhausting; ensure you take time for yourself.",

While not everyone will experience all of these symptoms, many people may encounter some of them.# Why is my loved one weak?In the final weeks and days of life, it is common to observe a decrease in energy and declines in day-to-day functioning. A very significant change occurs when the person is no longer strong enough to be out of bed. You may observe your loved one sleeping for long periods of time, tiring quickly, and having trouble arousing.## What can we do?- Regular re-positioning of your loved one to prevent skin breakdown and keep them comfortable. - Provision of pressure-reducing devices and mattresses if needed. - Planning of care to maximize quiet periods.## What can you do?- Plan conversations during periods of alertness.",

Can They See Me?As death approaches, vision and hearing are often affected, but it is unclear how much is perceived and processed. Since hearing remains until the moment of death, it is best to assume that conversations are understood and to avoid discussing distressing topics in the presence of a dying loved one.## What Can We Do?- Provide time and space for you and your family/friends to have private conversations if needed. - Relieve dry eyes with eye drops. - Minimize noise as much as possible.## What Can You Do?- Continue being a supportive friend and/or family in the presence of your loved one regardless of how alert they appear. Knowing that family members and/or friends are there and supporting one another can be most comforting to the dying person. - Keep disagreements away from the bedside.",

Family and friends may notice changes to the person’s skin as circulation decreases. The skin may feel clammy or damp, and blue or purple patches, similar to bruises, may appear on the arms, legs, and underside of the body. While the arms and legs may become cool to the touch, the person remains comfortable. This occurs as blood circulation slows down. The skin, especially on the hands and feet, may feel cool. This is often referred to as mottling by the staff.## What can we do? - Provide regular re-positioning. - Apply skin moisturizer as needed. - Provide additional blankets if necessary.## What can you do?",

There will be changes to the person’s regular breathing pattern. These changes in breathing are part of the dying process. They can make family and friends worry or feel upset; however, these are not signs that your loved one is uncomfortable.Breathing changes are often the most noticeable physical change as death approaches. These may include:\n- Deep or shallow breaths\n- Fast or slow breathing\n- Noisy breathing or gurgling sounds caused by saliva buildupThese noises happen because the person swallows less. Small amounts of fluid will collect in the throat, or the tongue will move back due to the relaxation of the jaw and throat muscles. They may also take shallow breaths with short periods of no breathing. These periods may last from seconds up to a minute.## What can we do?",
