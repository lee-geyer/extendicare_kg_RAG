# Benefits of a Healthy Diet and Hydration

## Why is it important for our residents to eat healthy, balanced food and drink enough fluids?

- Balanced diet supports energy, strength, and immune function
- Helps maintain weight and manage chronic conditions
- Promotes wound healing and skin health
- Hydration supports digestion, mental clarity, and prevents UTIs/constipation

# Dining Environment

The space where our residents eat is also important to making mealtimes enjoyable, which helps them eat and drink more.

## Atmosphere

- **Relaxing and Comfortable**
- Limit noises and distractions – turn off the TV, watch noise of clanking dishes
- Bright enough to see well but not too bright to be uncomfortable
- If it is too cold or too hot in the dining room, follow up with the Maintenance team

- **Social**
- Focus on and engage with the resident you are assisting - getting to know our residents means we will better understand their individual needs

## Positive Meal Experience

- Speak positively about the food and make sure it looks nice on the plate
- Don’t mix foods together (not nice to look at and flavor is not easy to identify)
- Offer the resident encouragement if needed
- ‘Can you try another bite? Those carrots look good.’
- Offer the resident assistance as needed
- ‘May I cut up the chicken for you?’ open packages, cut food, ensure utensils or glasses are within reach

# Factors that Affect How Residents Eat

## What things can cause a resident problems with eating or drinking?

### State of Mind
- **Depression** - can change appetite and amount of food eaten
- Some things we can try are to be there at mealtimes and chat with your resident lightly, even if you don’t expect a response.

### Appetite
- **Less appetite with older age**
- Feel full earlier
- Some things we can try are to offer snacks and fluids between meals.

### Eyes
- **Vision gets worse** which means it’s harder to see food on the plate and find the glass or cup.
- Some things we can try are to make sure the resident has their clean glasses on and to describe everything on the plate and where their drinks are.

# Factors that Affect How Residents Eat

## What things can cause a resident problems with eating or drinking?

| Muscles                           | Tongue                         | Taste Buds                       |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| As we age, muscle mass and strength naturally decrease, which can reduce a person’s ability to eat independently. | Tongue gets weaker, making it harder to move food around the mouth or clear food out of the mouth. | Taste can change with age – sweet & salty sensations decline while bitter and sour ones increase. |

### Some things we can try

- **Muscles**:
- Open packages
- Cut up food
- Move food closer to the resident
- Encourage the resident to eat slowly and swallow each bite

- **Tongue**:
- Offer level teaspoon sized bites
- Make sure the resident has swallowed before giving the next bite

- **Taste Buds**:
- Ask the nursing staff if the resident can have seasoning
- Season food if appropriate

# Factors that Affect How Residents Eat

## What things can cause a resident problems with eating or drinking?

### Digestive System
- Digestive system slows down as we age and can cause heartburn and/or constipation.
- Some things we can try might be:
- Offer level teaspoon sized bites.
- Encourage slower rate of eating.
- Encourage the resident to sit upright for 30 minutes after meals.

# Safe Mealtime Assistance - Why is it Important?

## Risks of Improper Assistance
- People who are not trained can cause aspiration
- This is when food and fluid goes into the lungs and can cause pneumonia.
- Choking can occur due to:
- Feeding too quickly or forcefully
- Giving large, unmanageable bites of food
- Not positioning the resident properly
