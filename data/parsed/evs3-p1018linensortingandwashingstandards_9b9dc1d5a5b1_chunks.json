Use towel formula. - Large homes should hold linens for a full load and not mix towels and sheets, if at all possible. - Blankets (cotton) and bedspreads (polyester) require separate wash cycles, as 100% cotton blankets hold a lot of water and therefore require higher extraction time and G force. - Supply enough holding bins in the Laundry Department for staff to separate.----**Helping people Iva better**\nThis document is uncontrolled when printed.
