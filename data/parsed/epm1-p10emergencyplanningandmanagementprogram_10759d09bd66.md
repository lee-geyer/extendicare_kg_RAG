## POLICY
The home will have an Emergency Preparedness and Management Program in effect that reflects The Incident Management System (IMS) and includes home-specific planning, response, and business continuity guides.

## STANDARD
- The Executive Director/Designate is responsible for the program.
- The Incident Manager is the most senior management member on location during the emergency unless otherwise designated by the Executive Director.
- The Incident Manager will assign the IMS roles that mimic everyday staff routines and responsibilities as closely as possible during an emergency. The Incident Manager may assign themselves all roles for a smaller emergency, multiple roles to one person, one role per person, or multiple people one role.
- During an emergency, the Executive Director/Designate will contact the Regional Director/Regional Director of Operations who will then enact the Issue Alert process.
- An Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) must be designated at the home as a central place for meetings and to coordinate the emergency response. An alternate EOC must also be designated outside the home in the event of a total evacuation, by the Executive Director/Designate.
- The Executive Director/Designate will conduct a Hazard Identification and Risk Analysis (HIRA) annually with the home’s interdisciplinary team to identify and assess the home specific risks.
- The Designate will prepare and update a minimum of 2 disaster boxes, one located in the EOC and one in a nursing station.
- The Executive Director/Designate will conduct a post-emergency debrief and evaluation of every incident and exercise, acknowledge staff participation, and take inventory of the expenses incurred as a result of the emergency incident.
- All staff will be educated on the emergency plans, including fire plans and where to locate them upon hire and annually thereafter.
- All staff will participate in drills or table-top exercises of the Emergency response codes during the designated code of the month (all emergency response codes will be practiced every year) as well as the following annually:
- Fire drills (one of each shift every month);
- Evacuation;
- R.E.A.C.T.;
