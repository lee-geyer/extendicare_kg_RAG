## POLICY

### Restorative Care

### PROCEDURE

Residents’ quality of life will be enriched through timely access to social work and social services that promote meaningful engagement, personal growth, and emotional well-being.

- Resident or Substitute Decision Maker (SDM)/Power of Attorney (POA) request
- Transition planning (e.g., move-in, hospitalization, discharge, or end-of-life care)
- Risk mitigation (e.g., social isolation, mental health concerns)
- Resident-led goals related to autonomy, social connection, or identity
- The Social Worker or Social Service Worker must complete the Restorative - Social Work Assessment to further identify strengths, needs, risks, and opportunities. Services may include:
- Move-in support
- Psychosocial case management
- Individual and/or group counselling
- Advance care planning and end-of-life care support
- Conflict resolution and interpersonal mediation
- Accessing external resources or advocacy (e.g., financial, legal, cultural)
