| 0     | Change in ADL status                           |
| 0     | Health condition: vomiting                      |
| 0     | Health condition: peripheral edema              |
| 0     | Health condition: dyspnea                      |
| 0,1   | End-stage disease                              |
| 0,1   | Weight loss                                    |

| 0,1   | Fluid output exceeds input                      |

**Range:** 0-5
**Scoring:**
- 0 = No health instability
- 1 = Minimal health instability
- 2 = Low health instability
- 3 = Moderate health instability
- 4 = High health instability
- 5 = Very high health instability

The CHESS¹ Scale is calculated by adding signs and symptom variables up to a maximum of 2, then adding three other variables (Change in decision making, change in ADL status, and End-stage disease), giving a highest CHESS score of 5.
