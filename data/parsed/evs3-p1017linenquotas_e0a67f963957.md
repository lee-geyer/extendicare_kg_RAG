## PROCEDURE

The Manager/designate and the Director of Care/designate will work together to:

1. Review the quota guidelines in Tools – 24-hour Quota Setting Guideline and make any necessary changes to accommodate the needs of the home. Update the guidelines in this manual.
2. Determine the amount of linen required daily on each home area, taking into consideration the level of care required, and document the quotas on – 24-hour Delivery Cart Set-Up.
3. Establish appropriate delivery time for linen distribution carts to be delivered to the home areas each day.
4. Review linen quotas as required. If requests are greater than 10% of quota on a regular basis, investigate the reason with staff.

6. Remember that laundry staff should be washing today what is needed tomorrow (2-to-2.5-day supply). Notify Executive Director if additional linen is required.
7. Educate laundry staff on their role in supplying quotas and communicating shortages of linen.
8. Educate care staff, with the assistance of nursing management, on linen product and policies, how quotas are established, and the support required from care staff to make the quota system work.
9. With nursing management, instruct charge nurses on their role in monitoring linen usage and policies on their home areas along with methods of requesting additional linen.
10. Post quotas in the Laundry Department or on exchange and/or top-up carts.
