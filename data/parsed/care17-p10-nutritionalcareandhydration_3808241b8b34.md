## Policy

Residents’ lives are enhanced by providing them optimal nutrition and hydration that promotes the best quality of life possible through all changes in health conditions, including palliative care.

## Standard

- All resident nutrition plans of care are developed to meet individually assessed nutrition and hydration needs.
- Interdisciplinary communication ensures all components of the resident’s nutritional plan of care are implemented.
- All resident-related communication to the Registered Dietitian (RD) is initiated using the Referral - Registered Dietitian tool. It is the RD’s responsibility to review and respond to all referrals in a timely manner.
- All resident-related communication to the Culinary Manager (CM) or designate is initiated using the Nutrition - Communication to Culinary Department tool. It is the responsibility of the CM to review and respond to all communications in a timely manner.
- Residents’ food and fluid intake are monitored and evaluated to ensure nutrition and hydration care needs are met.
- A weight monitoring system ensures significant weight changes are assessed, and interdisciplinary team interventions are implemented and evaluated.
- Appropriate nutritional supplements and prescribed snacks are provided based on individual resident needs and preferences.
- Upon move-in, all residents will have a standard fluid goal of 12 units per day (1500 ml per day), unless otherwise indicated due to fluid restrictions, end-of-life care or receiving enteral nutrition. Once assessed by the Registered Dietitian (where services available), the resident will have an individualized fluid goal determined and documented for reference.
- All residents are provided with a pleasurable and supportive dining environment with safe set-up or feeding assistance as required.
- Residents’ nutritional risks related to dysphagia are identified, assessed, and managed to ensure individual nutrition and hydration needs are met.
- Residents who have nutrition and hydration needs which cannot be met through oral intake may be considered for the provision of total or supplemental enteral feeding based on goals of care.
- Best practice supports the use of closed system enteral feeding when possible and homes are encouraged to adopt this practice in instances where enteral feeding is required.
- The nutrition and hydration program is monitored regularly and evaluated at least annually as outlined in the Quality Program.
- The goals of nutrition care will be adjusted through the stages of a resident’s disease or condition.
