Footwear should have a low, even heel and tread on the sole. If you're unsure, don't hesitate to ask the staff for support. - ◻ If you cannot wear safe shoes or slippers, ask for gripper socks instead. These socks have a non-slip sole, providing better traction and reducing the risk of slipping. - ◻ Use gripper socks at night. - ◻ Ensure your clothing is well-fitted. Pants and robes below the ankle are a trip hazard. - ◻ Consider protective equipment, such as hip protectors, to prevent injury if a fall occurs.### Transfer and Bathroom\nIf you're unsure about getting out of bed, always call for help. We're here to ensure your safety during every step of your day. - ◻ If you are unsteady, you will need help from the staff when moving from bed to a chair.",

Extendicare has the least restraint policy, which means we will use restraints temporarily when health and safety are at immediate risk, and no other alternatives are unavailable. A restraint is defined as any measure or equipment that you cannot remove yourself and limits your ability to move freely or access parts of your body that you cannot reach easily. Examples of restraints include seatbelts, tilt chairs, wheelchairs with fixed tray tables, foam pillows, bed rails, and hand mitts. Some medications may also be considered restraints.",
