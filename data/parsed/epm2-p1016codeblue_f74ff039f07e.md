## POLICY
### Emergency Response Codes

## PROCEDURE
Code Blue is announced when there is a medical emergency involving anyone on the property of the home.

### Responsibilities
- **Incident Manager and Executive Director/Designate:** Follow the procedures for Code Blue as per the designated Job Action checklists.

### All Staff:
- If you discover a medical emergency, contact a nurse or medical practitioner, or summon help immediately by calling out:
- **CODE BLUE. I need help in (location).**
- If it is determined to be a cardiac arrest and you are the first person on the scene trained in CPR, you must identify whether or not to initiate CPR by reviewing the Goals of Care (if available) to determine the resident’s wishes. When a resident's wishes are unknown, you must proceed with CPR. Begin CPR following current Basic Cardiac Life Support guidelines and using appropriate PPE as determined by a Point of Care Risk Assessment (PCRA).
- You are only to conduct CPR if you are trained to do so.
- If you are the second employee at the scene, announce **CODE BLUE**.
- Call 9-1-1 and state, “Medical emergency (describe the specific problem).” The dispatcher will need to know:
- Is the resident conscious?
- Is the resident breathing?
- What is the nature of the emergency?
- The location of the incident.
- The location telephone number.
- Report back to the emergency scene when calls are complete and follow instruction from the Incident Manager.
