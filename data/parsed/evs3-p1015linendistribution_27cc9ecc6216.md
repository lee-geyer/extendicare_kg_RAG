## POLICY

### Personal Clothing and Linen Processes

## PROCEDURE

### Manager or Designate:
- Determine whether your home will use the exchange cart system or the top-up system for distributing linens. Ensure you have a sufficient number of carts.
- Select a location(s) to store the cart(s), taking the following into consideration:
- Select areas where carts are easily accessible to care staff on the home area.
- Where possible, position the cart so that it discourages residents and other non-staff persons from accessing the linens on the cart. Cart covers can be equipped with mechanical fasteners or zippers to discourage access by residents and other non-staff persons.
- Work with the Director of Care/designate to establish times for delivery to the home areas, taking into account the time needed to rotate linen in the cupboard or on the cart.
- Review the procedures and adapt to the home’s specific needs.

### Laundry Staff:
- Process house linens according to home’s procedures.
- Place linens on cart in an organized manner following quotas. Notify the manager if you are unable to meet quota requirements.
- Cover cart prior to transportation to home areas.

### Care Staff and Laundry Staff:
- Following delivery schedule, deliver linen distribution carts to home areas.
- Return cart to the laundry or designated area.
- When transporting carts, always push – never pull. Move slowly and watch both sides of the cart for residents, staff, and visitors.
