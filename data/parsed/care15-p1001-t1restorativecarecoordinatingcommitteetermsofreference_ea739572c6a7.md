## Restorative Care Coordinating Committee - Terms of Reference

### Purpose
The Restorative Care Coordinating Committee (RCCC) provides oversight, interdisciplinary coordination, and guidance for planning, delivery, and evaluation of restorative care programs in the long-term care home.

### Objectives
- Coordinate referrals and assessments (e.g., restorative needs assessment, interRAI, therapy, nursing, social work) and evaluate outcomes to determine program eligibility and restorative program planning.
- Collaboratively identify the most appropriate restorative care interventions or complementary blend of programs, including nursing rehabilitation, specialized rehabilitation, social work interventions, restorative respiratory therapy, and recreation therapy.
- Ensure integration of restorative principles across all disciplines to promote consistent, individualized, and goal-oriented restorative practices that align with resident strengths, preferences, and care goals.
- Monitor outcome data (e.g., RUG-III classifications, ADL improvement, mobility, psychosocial wellbeing) to drive quality improvement.
- Support continuous quality improvement and staff education.
