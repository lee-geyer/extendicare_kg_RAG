### Resident Care Decisions

Health care professionals may be faced with the decision about the safety of residents and visitors in their care who may not be able to evacuate due to age, injury, illness, disability, or because of an ongoing medical procedure.

Every reasonable attempt to continue caring for residents must be made, but in the event this becomes impossible without putting others at risk for loss of life, certain decisions must be made.

### If an assailant is on, or in close proximity to your unit/resident home area:

If an assailant is on, or in close proximity to your Unit/Resident Home Area, and you are with a resident you may have to make decisions about your own personal safety and the temporary discontinuation of resident care. Staff should take steps to protect residents if there is time and using a method that does not jeopardize the personal safety of the staff or interfere with Police actions. These steps may include evacuating the area or preventing entry to an area where the active assailant is located. However, during an active assailant situation staff may find there is not sufficient time to do anything but to ensure their own safety. In this instance, as soon as the situation has resolved the staff should promptly resume care of residents.

- Staff are to follow the RUN, HIDE, FIGHT action plan, even if you are engaged in resident care.
- Temporarily discontinue all resident care.
- Assist residents to evacuate with you if they are able and if it is safe to do so.
- If you are with a resident who cannot escape with you:
- Let the resident know that you have to leave.
- Instruct the resident to remain calm and stay alert.
- Instruct the resident to remain quiet and not to make contact with the assailant.
- Turn off the lights in the resident room and secure the door as best you can upon exiting.

If RUN is not a safe option, hide in as safe a place as possible. If it is best for you to remain in a resident’s room, follow the HIDE actions, in the Response Algorithm. If you are in a specialty care unit, secure the unit entrance(s) by any means available (e.g. door locks, furniture, cabinets, bed, equipment, supply carts, etc.).
