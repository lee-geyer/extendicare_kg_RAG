## POLICY

### Preventative Maintenance Program

### PROCEDURE

- In your Preventative Maintenance Program, the Maintenance Manager/Designate will need to schedule and carry out regular inspections for all major equipment in the home.
- The Preventive Maintenance Program is home specific. It is intended to address the needs of the major equipment in the facility. It is achieved by listing, scheduling and carrying out regular inspections and work that is recommended for each piece of equipment to ensure that it continues to operate in a safe and predictable manner.
- The 4 steps to the development of a Preventative Maintenance Program are:
1. Develop a list of the key equipment and systems in the building.
2. For each piece of equipment or for each system, develop a series of maintenance tasks that are required and the frequency at which each should be performed.
3. Develop a schedule that allows the Maintenance Department to plan for each task that is required for each piece of equipment so that all tasks are performed as frequently as required (homes may have computerized systems like Maintenance Care).
4. Develop a system to record that this maintenance activity is taking place.
- Maintenance Manager/Designate is responsible for the following:
- Ensure that the preventive maintenance is being documented, and records kept of preventive maintenance carried out on all major equipment and systems. They are also responsible for evaluating the program annually.
- Speak with residents prior to May 15th and after September 15th of each year to schedule a time for installation/removal of portable A/C resident room. If the resident A/C, document in Point Click Care (PCC) and in Maintenance Care. Residents change their decision for A/C at any time but will continue to be offered annually.
*(Note: For information on requirements for monitoring weather and internal building temperatures policy and procedure for Preventing Heat Related Illness).*
- Portable A/C units are to be stored on site to ensure easy access for installation. A/C units are to be installed promptly following request by resident/POA.
