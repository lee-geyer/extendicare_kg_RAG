The total body assessment will be completed:\n- Within 24 hours of move-in\n- Upon return from the hospital or leave of absence greater than 24 hours\n- With a significant change in status affecting skin integrity\n- Assessment outcomes will inform an individualized plan of care outlining preventative measures such as repositioning at a minimum of every 2 hours for residents unable to reposition independently, pressure-relieving devices, and measures that support skin hygiene and moisture balance. - The home will have a process in place for obtaining photos of new or worsening skin conditions for reassessment, which will be recorded in the resident’s health record.",
