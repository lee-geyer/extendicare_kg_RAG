This is because CRM activities/projects can disperse dust particles contaminated with bacteria and fungi into the air and cause health care-associated infections (HAIs).3. **Who should be involved in IPAC during CRM activities/projects?**\nIt is a team effort to help prevent HAIs related to CRM activities/projects. From contractors to management, environmental services to front line staff, and infection prevention and control; we all have a part to play to keep our residents, visitors, and staff safe while construction projects are occurring.4.",

Any CRM activities/projects should involve an interdisciplinary team (e.g., IPAC, Nursing, Management, Environmental Services, etc.). Depending on the size of the project, the size of the interdisciplinary team (IDT) will vary. For small CRM activities/projects (e.g., painting or changing a ceiling tile), the IDT can be simply composed of the maintenance personnel and IPAC. For larger projects, the IDT should involve management and multiple departments (i.e., it cannot just fall on IPAC and/or maintenance only). As a general guideline, any activities/projects that require Preventive Measures III & IV must have a large IDT during the planning process.## 11.

As long as there is detailed, documented evidence of an audit taking place daily, the home is considered in compliance.## 12. Who do I reach out to if I have any questions?

While there needs to be an ICRA for all CRM activities/projects in the home, there is no need to start a new ICRA for every single work (especially for minor maintenance work that requires Preventive Measures I & II). The home can opt to re-use previous ICRAs if the work being planned is going to be similar in scope and requires the same preventive measures. For example, if the home has created an ICRA to address painting in one of the residents’ rooms, then a new ICRA is not needed as long as the scope of the work is the same (i.e., painting only in a resident’s room). Make sure that the details of the ICRA are updated to reflect the project (i.e., the date, the area where the project will take place, etc.). However, a new ICRA must be created if the scope of work (e.g., painting + sanding) or the preventive measures changes (e.g., the painting will take place in the medication room, near medications).## 13.
