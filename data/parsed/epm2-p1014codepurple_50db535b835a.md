### Emergency Response Codes

## PROCEDURE

### Prevent/Prepare
- If you notice an individual with a weapon or acting aggressively, do not open the door for them and try not to allow them entry into the home.
- Review the Code Purple, Taken Hostage Tip Sheet so that you are familiar with what to do if you are taken hostage.

### Respond

- Do not announce the code overhead as this may cause panic for the hostage taker.
- If you are not in the area of the active Code Purple, stay away.
- Get away from immediate danger and evacuate residents from the area if safe to do so.
- Call the police (9-1-1) and provide as much information as possible, i.e., location of the incident, number of hostage takers and hostages, physical description and names of the hostage takers and hostages (if known), any weapons involved (if known), your name, location, and telephone number.
- Incident Manager and Executive Director/Designate - follow the procedures for Code Purple as per the designated Job Action checklists.
- All staff - follow direction from the Incident Manager.
- Do not speak to the media. Do not use telephones or social media, including your wireless devices.
