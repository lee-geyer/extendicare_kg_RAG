Suicidal screening must be completed for the following:\n- Depression Rating Scale (DRS) score is 3 or greater on admission application or during Move-in assessments. - Residents have expressions of self-harm or suicidal thoughts either self-reported or reported by care providers, SDM/POA, family/friends. - History of self-harm/suicidal thinking. - Known family history of suicide/suicide attempts. - Active substance use disorder.",
