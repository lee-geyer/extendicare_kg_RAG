## POLICY

### Communicable Diseases

### PROCEDURE

- Staff will monitor residents for signs and symptoms of influenza-like illness, which may be related to Legionnaires’ Disease or Pontiac fever and will report the possible infection to the Infection Control Professional (ICP)/Designate.

Possible signs and symptoms of Legionnaires’ Disease or Pontiac fever include:
- High temperature, fever, chills

### Prevention

- The home will utilize and implement the relevant components of the Water Safety Plan to maintain the safety of the water systems for residents and staff.
- Any discolored water shall be promptly reported to the maintenance staff.
- The home will mitigate risk factors for Legionella in the building’s water system by routinely decreasing stagnation of water, minimizing water interruptions (whether planned or unplanned), and maintaining all plumbing fixtures (e.g., pipes, toilets, sinks, faucets, showerheads, etc.) to ensure they are free of corrosion, cracks, scale, and biofilm build-up.
- Be mindful of external factors such as boil water advisories, water shutdowns (whether planned or unplanned), or any construction adjacent to the home that may increase risk.
- Maintenance staff will perform and document routine preventative maintenance of water systems and fixtures, as outlined in the Maintenance Handbook and Water Safety Plan, following manufacturer’s guidelines for each piece of equipment.
- The home will utilize the preventive maintenance template in the Water Safety Plan to record proactive actions performed to the building’s water systems.
- The home will ensure that the use of personal humidifiers is prohibited.

### Management

- If there is a confirmed/suspected case of Legionella in a resident, the ICP/Designate will immediately notify the health authority and all appropriate stakeholders to launch an investigation.
- The home will follow health authority directions in response to a suspect/confirmed Legionella case in either a resident or staff.
- The home will heighten symptom surveillance in affected resident area(s). Refer to symptoms listed above.
