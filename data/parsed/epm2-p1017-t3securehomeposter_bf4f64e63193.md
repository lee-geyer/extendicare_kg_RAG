# SECURE HOME

## Emergency Response

### What does it mean?
Secure Home is the designated phrase to alert staff of the need to remain inside the home with the doors and windows locked.

### What do I do?
1. Close and lock all outside windows and doors.
2. Close all curtains to the outside.
3. Announce 3 times, “Secure Home.”
4. If the secure home isn’t informed by the police, call 9-1-1 and provide them with as much detail as possible.
5. Stay away from all outside windows and doors.
6. Do not leave the building and instruct others not to leave.
7. Remain in Secure Home until instructed by Police that the threat has ended.

### Review it before you need it:
- Refer to your Home’s Emergency Planning and Management Manual, Secure Home.
- Review the Secure Home procedure and checklist that describes your area’s role if a Secure Home is enacted.
