Response During Normal Operating Hours:\n- The supervisor, Executive Director or designate shall evaluate the reported incident and, if it is believed to truly be an emergency, notify the maintenance staff immediately by the quickest means possible, such as by overhead paging, walkie-talkie, mobile phone, cell phone, in person, etc.",
