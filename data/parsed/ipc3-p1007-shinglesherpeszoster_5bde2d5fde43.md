## POLICY
### Communicable Diseases

## PROCEDURE

### Prevention
- Educate, inform, and offer eligible residents, family, and staff to obtain the shingles vaccine.

### Assessment
- Evaluate and document any skin lesions or rashes the resident may have and refer for further medical assessment.
- Assess exposure risk and susceptibility of residents, staff, and visitor contacts.

### Treatment and Management of a Resident Case
- Determine if the disease is disseminated or non-disseminated.
- For localized lesions (non-disseminated) in an immunocompetent resident:
- Cover lesions to prevent transmission to susceptible individuals.
- Use Routine Practices when caring for residents with localized lesions which can be covered or are crusted.
- Only immune staff should care for those residents where the care involves open lesions. If circumstances make this necessary, PPE (i.e., gloves and gown) must be worn.
- If localized lesions cannot be covered (e.g., on the fingers), the resident should be placed on Contact Precautions until all lesions have crusted.
- For disseminated lesions that cannot be covered or disseminated or localized lesions in an immunocompromised resident:
- Consult with primary care provider to determine if resident requires transfer to hospital to be placed in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR).
- Use Contact and Airborne Precautions until all lesions are crusted.
- Keep the door closed.
- The resident should be out of the room for essential purposes only. If the resident is out of their room, they must wear a surgical/procedure mask and have skin lesions covered.
- Susceptible individuals should not enter or occupy the room. If circumstances make this necessary, an N95 respirator must be worn.
- Keep the resident in a room away from susceptible, immunocompromised residents.
- Antivirals should be initiated based on physician or nurse practitioner orders, as soon as possible.

# PROCEDURE

**SECTION:** Communicable
**DESCRIPTION:** Shingles (Herpes Zoster)
**INDEX:** IPC3-P10.07

## Management – Exposed Susceptible Individuals
- Ensure affected residents' nails are trimmed.
- Document all care and required precautions in the resident’s plan of care.
- Provide information and education to residents, families, and staff.

- Identify exposed individuals (staff, visitors, and residents) and determine immune status, if possible.
- Follow Public Health direction for follow-up for susceptible, exposed individuals.
- Conduct surveillance for chickenpox for 21 days (one incubation period) after the last exposure to shingles. For those who have received varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) and where immunocompromised individuals are involved, surveillance should continue for 28 days.

## Management – Staff with Shingles
- Staff with localized shingles should cover lesions with a dressing and where possible, with clothing when working.
- If localized lesions cannot be covered (e.g., on the fingers) staff will be excluded from work until lesions are crusted.
- Staff with localized or disseminated lesions should be referred to their primary care provider as soon as possible for necessary interventions.
- Staff with disseminated lesions should be excluded from work until lesions are crusted.
- Staff who are immunocompromised and have localized lesions should be excluded from work until lesions are crusted.
- The Infection Control Professional/Designate should be informed of a staff member with a suspected or confirmed case of disseminated or uncovered localized lesions as soon as possible.

## Communication and Reporting
- Infection Control Professional / Designate will:
- Communicate with and educate the staff, volunteers, and families.
- Notify provincial/regional public health authorities as per provincial/regional requirements.
