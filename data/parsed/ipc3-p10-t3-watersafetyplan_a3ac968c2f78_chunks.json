      "text": "# BACKGROUND## What is Legionella? Legionella is a type of bacteria that is normally found in freshwater environments such as lakes and streams, but the low amounts in freshwater do not lead to disease. Legionella can become a health problem in building water systems because they often provide the means for Legionella to reproduce, increase in numbers, and contaminate the building’s water system.When Legionella is aerosolized and inhaled by high-risk individuals (such as residents, immunocompromised individuals, asthmatic staff, etc.), it can cause a type of pneumonia called Legionnaires’ disease, which may lead to severe illness and death.## What is a Water Safety Plan (WSP)? A Water Safety Plan (WSP) is one of the best ways to mitigate the risk of water system contamination by Legionella species. Water contamination can occur between the delivery of water (e.g., municipal supply) and consumption/use (e.g., resident sink/shower/etc.).The home’s water system can become contaminated due to several reasons. Stagnant water (e.g., dead legs, unused faucets, etc.) can allow biofilm to form in the water system. Legionellae live and reproduce within biofilm.",

      "text": "Stagnant water (e.g., dead legs, unused faucets, etc.) can allow biofilm to form in the water system. Legionellae live and reproduce within biofilm. Biofilms can act as constant sources of contamination and are difficult to eliminate once established in the water system.Construction, water main breaks, and changes in municipal water quality can contribute to contaminating the home’s water system by encouraging the growth of Legionella.The World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Ontario Ministries of Health and Long-Term Care (MOH and MLTC) recommend water safety plans for all LTCs. The WSP guides the home to monitor the water system and immediately respond to any risks. The WSP includes a sampling plan, acceptable Legionella limits, and recommendations on how to respond.# PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE\n``````markdown",
