## POLICY

### Personal Clothing and Linen Processes

## PROCEDURE

### Manager or Designate:

- Working with the home’s chemical representative, prepare a chart with guidelines for sorting/washing and post the chart for the Laundry staff. The items on the chart will include:
- Personals
- Clothing protectors - pre-wash when new before circulating
- Sheets
- Towels
- Towels and sheets (Small homes 60-100 beds may put these items together)
- Blankets
- Bed spreads
- Bed pads, if using
- Mops/housekeeping cloths
- Cleaning cloths – wash dietary cleaning cloths in their own cycle due to grease content
- Table cloths/placemats and nursing aprons
- Kitchen aprons
- Delicates – drapes and privacy curtains
- Isolation – always wash separate from non-isolation loads using designated formula
- Rewash – always wash separate using designated formula

### Consider the following:

- Small homes might need to mix sheets and towels to make a full load. Use towel formula.
- Large homes should hold linens for a full load and not mix towels and sheets, if at all possible.
- Blankets (cotton) and bedspreads (polyester) require separate wash cycles, as 100% cotton blankets hold a lot of water and therefore require higher extraction time and G force.
- Supply enough holding bins in the Laundry Department for staff to separate.

# PROCEDURE

## SECTION: Personal Clothing and Linen Processes - Laundry
### DESCRIPTION: Linen Sorting and Washing
### INDEX: EVS3-P10.18

----

### Soiled Linen Handling
- Ensure bins are designated for soiled linen use.
- Ensure appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is available to staff.
- Instruct staff not to shake soiled linen in the laundry room.

### WASHING
- Ensure washing formulas are posted for each machine.
- Monitor washing process to ensure staff is following the correct handling/sorting, loading procedures, and wash formulas.
- If staff is not consistently following procedures for sorting and loading, review the procedures with them.
- If staff is underloading or overloading machines, consider providing them with a weigh scale designed for this purpose and instruct them to weigh every load.
- **See Appendix 1 – Photo Sample of Weigh Scales.**

#### Items most consistently requiring weighing are:
- Sheets
- Towels
- Bed pads, if used
- Personal clothing

### Laundry Staff Responsibilities
- Put on required personal protective equipment (PPE) prior to handling soiled linen bags.
- Sort bags into appropriate holding containers, placing all like-coloured bags together (the same types of items together) in the same bin. Use only bins indicated for soiled linen usage.
- Once all bags have been sorted into the proper bins, remove your gloves, and wash your hands.
- If soiled linen needs to be sorted, make sure you are wearing the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and do not shake the linen.

### WASHING
- Before handling soiled bags for washing, make sure you are wearing the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
- Take the holding bin(s) to the washing machine.
- Release drawstring and open bag enough to empty the contents of the bag directly into the washing machine and put the empty bag into the washer. If soiled linen is loose in the bin, carefully place linen in the washer, avoiding unnecessary agitation.
- Load washing machine, being careful not to overload. Follow the steps below to estimate the load size visually or use a scale if one is provided.

#### To estimate the load size visually:

# PROCEDURE

## SECTION: Personal Clothing and Linen Processes - Laundry
### DESCRIPTION: Linen Sorting and Washing
### INDEX: EVS3-P10.18

1. Bring wash wheel in position so that one of the ribs is at the 12 o'clock position.
2. Continue emptying contents of bags into the washer until there is one fist space between the bottom of the rib and the top of the load. Laundry bags may be added to the wash load.
3. The proper loading of a washing machine should show the linen falling from the 11:00 o'clock position and 1:00 o'clock position in the wash wheel. You should be able to hear the linen splashing against the inner drum rims creating "mechanical action".
4. Select the correct wash formula as indicated on the posted charts. Using the wrong formula could create the need for more chemical and a longer wash cycle.
5. Whenever possible, leave items until a full load has been reached. If unsure, check with Manager/designate for direction.
6. Remove your gloves and wash your hands before touching any clean linen.
7. Notify your manager if linens are not clean after the wash cycle.
