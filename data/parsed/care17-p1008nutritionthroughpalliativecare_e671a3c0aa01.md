## POLICY

### Nutritional Care and Hydration

----

## PROCEDURE

- Resident nutrition plans of care are developed to meet individually assessed nutrition and hydration needs when a resident’s status changes from Stable to Transitional or End-of-Life.
- The goals of nutrition care will be adjusted throughout the phases of a resident’s disease. In the early stages, nutritional intervention may be required to support nutritional requirements and individual goals. Towards the end of life, the goal is to maximize food enjoyment and diminish food-related discomfort, which may result in modification of nutrition goals and interventions to support overall comfort and quality of life.
- The resident and/or substitute decision maker (SDM)/Power of Attorney (POA) are involved in the discussion of goals of care and nutrition plan of care. Documents are available to facilitate discussion (see Education).

### Stable and Transitional

- Nutrition can provide residents with the energy they need and reduce infection, improving quality of life. Interventions should be chosen to meet individual needs and goals.
- Changes to the current plan of care may be appropriate and should be discussed with the resident and/or SDM/POA as well as the interdisciplinary team to ensure alignment.
- For residents unable to meet their needs orally, the advanced care planning information should be referenced, if applicable. Discussion with the resident and/or SDM/POA regarding enteral feeding or artificial hydration should encompass both potential benefits and potential negative effects including risk. The nutrition plan for end-of-life should also be discussed at this time.
- Comfort or hand feeding may be the appropriate option.

### End-of-Life

- As resident transitions to the last few weeks and days of life, they are unlikely to meet their nutrition and hydration requirements. Eating and drinking at this time should be for enjoyment rather than nutrition. The focus should be on symptom control, physical care, and psychological and spiritual support.

# PROCEDURE

## SECTION: Nutritional Care
### DESCRIPTION: Nutrition Through Palliative Care
### INDEX: CARE17-P10.08

- Oral nutritional supplements should be reassessed as part of the plan of care review. Supplements may continue to be appropriate or may be an additional burden to the resident.
- Changes to the current plan of care may be appropriate and should be discussed with the resident and/or SDM/POA as well as the interdisciplinary team to ensure alignment.
- Discussion of enteral or artificial hydration may need to be revisited with the resident and/or SDM/POA. Providing enteral or artificial hydration may increase resident discomfort during the last days of life.
- Comfort or hand feeding as tolerated is usually the appropriate option at this time with emphasis on enjoyed foods and beverages.
