# Extendicare HOME NAME Emergency Response Plan

## Purpose
The Purpose of this Emergency Response Plan is to assist the individuals at the home with the resources and information they need at their fingertips at the time of the emergency. To utilize this Plan to the full potential will require some setup at the home level.

- Tab 3, Emergency Contacts, must be completed and inserted into this binder.
- The Business Continuity Plan in Tab 4 and Home Schematics in Tab 6 must also be added.
- This plan is to be used in conjunction with your Disaster Recovery Box and should be located at reception and in the nursing station (or wherever makes most sense in the home based on ease of accessibility).

## Setup
Once setup, in this plan you will find:

- The different risk levels associated with emergencies so that you may categorize the emergency you are in and identify the required communications.
- The process for communication with corporate office and the media throughout the emergency.
- Information on what to do in the event of the activation of any of the emergency colour codes, including checklists to guide you throughout the emergency.
- Home-specific emergency contacts such as:
- Home managers
- LTC consultant
- RD
- Hydro/electrical and local emergency numbers
- Staff call back list
- Equipment maintenance and repair contacts
- List of volunteers, their skills and contact information
- Address and contact information for the area of refuge
- Reports, tracking sheets and checklist for use during an emergency.
- A list of the IMS titles as well as suggestions of who you may designate these roles to.

## Reference
Page 3 of this plan provides reference to tools in Extendicare’s Emergency Planning and Management Manual. These tools are useful for emergency planning and knowledge of what to do after the emergency has ended. The tools listed can be found where indicated.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding emergency preparedness, please reach out by email to riskmanagement@extendicare.com.

An emergency situation has occurred or is anticipated at a home that:
- Has not resulted in serious injury to residents or staff;
- Poses minimal to no threat to the home and/or Extendicare’s reputation and/or operations;
- Affects only one home;

- May harm or has the potential to harm residents or staff;
- Will affect the home and/or Extendicare’s reputation and/or operations;
- May potentially pose a risk to other homes regionally or nationally; and
- May pose a potential risk to numerous homes and media coverage is expected.

# Tab 4 - During the Emergency

## Command Centre
During an emergency, the Front Office is the designated command centre, unless the emergency involves that area; all management of the emergency will occur from the command centre.
The Secondary Command Centre is the 1st Floor Nursing Station.
The Incident Manager will manage the emergency from the command centre.
The command centre contains the grid map of the area.
Communication with the emergency scene and the command centre is to be constant, maintained by telephone/walkie-talkie. In the event the facility phones are not working, IMS will use personal cell phones. 2-way radio communication will commence with the arrival of the Fire Department/EMS/RCMP.

## Disaster Box
An emergency box is located in the 1st floor photocopy room and at the 2nd floor nursing station.

## Situation Report
The purpose of this report is to:
- Document the time and details of significant events;
- Provide a report to other IMS leaders of significant events to be presented during Emergency Operations Centre meetings; and
- Summarize actions taken before and after the emergency situation.

## Incident Tracking Sheet
The tracking sheet ensures IMS leaders can easily prioritize their needs and quickly file service requests. It is used to:
- Document all information and/or requests for services that come through the Emergency Operations Center; and
- Follow through on requests for information.

## Business Continuity Plan
This home-specific plan tells the Incident Manager what they need to do and who they can contact to ensure continuity of care during an emergency.

2. Keep evacuation meeting area off and away from major driveways or fire routes that emergency vehicles use.
3. Ensure the evacuation meeting areas are on the opposite end of the parking lot from the home – providing some distance from the building.
4. Use lawn areas if parking lots are not accessible.

6. Ensure areas have exterior lighting to enable safe walking during night hours.
7. Choose evacuation meeting areas away from potential hazards such as electrical transformers, natural gas lines/meters, propane, or other fuel storage.
8. Mark each area with a sign that indicates its purpose and location such as “Evacuation Meeting Area B”.
