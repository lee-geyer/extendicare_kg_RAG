# Infection Control Preventive Measures

## Preventive Measures 1
1. Review infection control risk assessment (ICRA) agreement before work begins.
2. Complete a clean of the area where the construction activities will take place.
3. Education of all staff (e.g., PSWs, nurses, maintenance, activity, housekeeping, etc.) in the home on the IPAC measures in place, especially those that work in areas that are adjacent to the construction zone.
4. All the affected residents will be identified, and a plan is put in place to move them away from the construction zone.
5. Protect resident care equipment and supplies from dust exposure.
6. Essential services that will be disrupted (e.g., water supply, electricity, HVAC) must be identified, and a contingency plan is put in place to replace such services in the affected areas.
7. Execute work by methods to minimize raising dust from construction operations (e.g., by covering the work area).
8. Immediately replace any ceiling tile displaced for visual inspections.
9. Report discolored water and water leaks to maintenance.

**Comments / special instructions:**
- PM 1 shall be followed as well.

## Preventive Measures 2
1. Determine a safe route for the transportation of the clean or sterile supplies (e.g., clean linen & medications) and equipment (e.g., lifts & blood pressure machines) away from the construction area.
2. Establish traffic patterns for the construction workers that avoid, or at the minimum reduce, adverse impacts on resident care areas.
3. Provide active means to prevent airborne dust from dispersing into the atmosphere (e.g., using HEPA-filtered vacuum at the point of drilling or sanding to capture all generated dust).
4. Use drop sheets to contain the work area and the dust generated. The drop sheets should be 0.15 mm (6 mil) fire-retardant polyethylene (poly) sheet.
- Note: You can use two layers of 3 mil poly sheet if 6 mil is not readily available.
5. Water mist work surfaces to control dust while cutting.
6. Seal unused doors, adjacent to the construction area, with duct tape.
7. Block off and seal air vents using duct tape and 6 mil fire-retardant polyethylene (poly) sheet.

# Preventive Measures

1. Seal electrical plugs, drains, laundry chutes, plumbing penetrations, and other sources of air leak using duct tape and fire-retardant 6 mil poly sheet.
2. Wipe work surfaces with disinfectant after completion of each task.
3. Vacuum the area (with HEPA-filtered vacuum) and wet mop area daily with a medical-grade low level disinfectant.
**Note:** Only HEPA-filtered vacuums (refer to glossary) can be used to clean and contain construction debris. Regular vacuums are not appropriate and can further spread infectious particles.
4. Place walk-off mat (sticky mat) at entrance and exit of work area.
**Note:** The walk-off mats must be cleaned/changed daily, and when soiled.
5. Remove or isolate HVAC system in areas where work is being performed (if possible).
6. Construction debris must be well contained during transport. This can be done using tightly covered carts or double bagging the debris.
7. Construction workers must HEPA vacuum their clothes and boots before exiting the construction area.
**Note:** Alternatively, the workers can choose to wear protective clothing (e.g., Tyvek suits) when entering the construction area. The protective clothing is then removed before exiting the area.
8. Flush potable water lines in the construction area and adjacent areas before re-use.

## Comments/Special Instructions:
Preventive Measures 1 & 2 shall be followed as well:
1. Minimize dust accumulation and the buildup of debris in the work area. Ensure that all the construction debris is removed at the end of each day, at minimum.
2. Erect an impermeable dust barrier, from the floor to the underside of the deck (including the areas above false ceilings) consisting of two layers of 0.15 mm (6 mil) fire-retardant poly plastic sheets.

# Construction Air Management Procedures

## Guidelines for Air Management During Construction

1. **Containment Measures**
- A containment cube can be set up if the work area is small enough to be contained by the cube.

2. **Air Pressure Maintenance**
- Maintain negative air pressure (minimum 7.5 Pa/0.03 inches water column) within the work site utilizing HEPA-equipped Construction Air Handling Units (CAHU).

3. **Exhausting Construction Air**
- Do not exhaust construction air back into the home, or outdoor areas where residents would be present (e.g., courtyard) even when HEPA-equipped CAHUs are used to filter the construction air.
- Do not exhaust construction air using the home’s permanent HVAC system.
- Do not exhaust construction air near any of the home’s air intakes.

> **Note:** If construction air must be exhausted using the home’s permanent HVAC system and/or near areas where residents would gather outdoors (e.g., courtyard), then the home must consult the IDT and the corporate IPAC Consultant first.

4. **Sealing Windows and Doors**
- If construction air will be exhausted near resident windows and/or doors, then such windows and/or doors shall be sealed using transparent poly sheet and tape.

5. **Work Area Management**
- Do not remove barriers from the work area until the project is completed, and the area is thoroughly cleaned.
- Vacuum the area (with a HEPA-filtered vacuum) and wet mop the area daily with a medical-grade low-level disinfectant.
- The home’s housekeeping shall clean areas adjacent to the construction zone twice daily, for the duration of the project.
- HEPA vacuum erected barriers and wipe with detergent before removal.
- Remove the barrier material carefully to minimize spreading of dirt and debris associated with construction (e.g., folding them towards the center).
- Contain construction waste before transport in tightly covered containers.
- Consider hyper-chlorinating or superheating stagnant potable water.

# Preventive Measures

## PM 1, 2 and 3 shall be followed as well

1. Construct anteroom at access points to the construction area if access is from within the health care facility.
2. Maintain the anteroom under negative pressure of 2.5 Pa (0.01” WC) relative to the non-construction area.
3. Place walk off mats inside and outside the anteroom.
4. Ensure construction workers:
a. Leave the construction area through the anterooms so they can be vacuumed using a HEPA vacuum cleaner before leaving worksite; or
b. Wear protective clothing to be removed each time they leave the construction area and before going into resident care areas.
5. Repair holes in walls within 8 hours or seal them temporarily.
6. Ensure that ventilation systems are working properly in adjacent areas.

# Step 4: Final Construction Clean and Terminal Clean

After the above steps have been completed and the area is ready to be handed over, the constructor must complete a final clean of the entire work area including the barriers that were erected. The final construction clean must ensure that there is no visible debris or dust on any of the surfaces or in any areas (e.g., crevices, cabinets, etc.). The final clean process should follow the following steps:

1. Remove all visible debris and dust in the construction area through a combination of HEPA vacuuming and cleaning with detergents.
2. HEPA vacuum erected barriers and wipe with detergent before removal.
3. Visual inspection of the cleaned construction area by a designate from the home, such as the IPAC Lead, to ensure that there is no visible dust or debris in the cleaned area.
4. After a successful visual inspection, remove the barrier material carefully to minimize spreading of dirt and debris associated with construction (e.g., folding them towards the centre).

Once the final clean is completed, the visual inspection is done, and the barriers are removed, the home’s housekeeping department conducts a terminal clean with a facility-approved disinfectant. The terminal clean shall follow Extendicare’s current policies for terminal clean (refer to the Environmental Services/Housekeeping and Laundry Manual).

# Glossary

## Anteroom
A room that is immediately adjacent to or within a construction area and is intended to be used by constructors for purposes such as storage or removal of protective clothing, cleaning of debris-removal containers, and/or removal of contaminants from footwear. The anteroom also provides an airlock between the resident care area and the construction area.

## Construction Air Handling Unit (CAHU)
A machine used to move HEPA-filtered air into or out of a construction site. CAHUs can be used to develop negative pressure from within the construction space or positive pressure outside of the construction space. They can be outfitted with a variety of filters to “scrub” the surrounding air and remove and capture several types of contaminants such as dust, mould spores, and certain chemical agents or odors.

> **Note:** CAHU can be commonly referred to as “negative pressure machine”.

## Construction/Renovation Activity Type
A designation applied to a construction project to indicate its potential for creating and dispersing fungus, bacteria, and other hazardous materials.

## Constructor
A person or organization responsible for the construction, renovation, or maintenance of healthcare facilities. A constructor can be the facility’s own maintenance staff or an external contractor.

## Containment Cube
Mobile containment and isolation units designed to be set up quickly and easily to establish a temporary negative pressure environment.

## HEPA-filtered Vacuum
A vacuum cleaner equipped with HEPA filtration capable of being performance leak tested.

## Hyper-chlorinating
The process of increasing the concentration of chlorine in a water distribution system.

## Polyethylene (Poly) Sheet
A versatile plastic film made from petroleum (also referred to as polyethylene sheeting, poly sheeting, plastic sheeting, plastic film, and poly film).

## Poly Zip Wall
Dust barrier that consists of polyethylene (poly) sheets with a certain thickness (e.g., 3 mil).

## Population Risk Group
A system that divides the population affected by the construction activities based on their susceptibility.

## Superheating
The process of heating the water in the water distribution system to a temperature higher than its boiling point, without boiling.
