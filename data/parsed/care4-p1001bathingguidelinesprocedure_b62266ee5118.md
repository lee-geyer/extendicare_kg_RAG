## PROCEDURE

- Residents are offered their preferred method of bathing (shower, tub bath, full sponge body bath, or bed bath) at a minimum of twice weekly.
- Bed linens will also be changed weekly on bathing days, or as needed.
- Where a resident declines bathing, the Unregulated Care Provider (UCP) will inform the nurse who will document the resident’s choice, including the reason for bathing decline in the health record. An alternate day and/or time for bathing will be offered.
- UCPs will refer to the resident’s plan of care/kardex for care instructions, which will include the required supervision or level of physical assistance required for bathing.
- Residents will be encouraged to actively participate in bathing to promote independence to the highest extent possible.
- UCPs will report any changes or abnormalities observed during the bathing experience to the nurse to ensure timely intervention to support change in care status.
- Staff will adhere to the following safety and infection prevention measures during all tub baths and showers:
- Create a private space as much as possible to ensure the resident has a dignified bathing experience.
- Avoid using electrical appliances near the shower/bath area.
- Wipe up spills immediately to prevent slipping hazards.
- Ensure residents capable of using grab bars do so for support.
- Confirm the call bell is always within the resident’s reach.
- Use all necessary safety equipment and precautions appropriately.
- Verify the resident is correctly seated, and the seat belt on the tub chair is securely fastened before lifting into the tub.
- Ensure all required supplies are ready before beginning the bath.
- Check water temperatures before immersing the resident in the tub or shower.
- Never leave the resident unattended in the bathtub or the bath/shower.

## DESCRIPTION: Bathing Guidelines
## INDEX: CARE4-P10.01

### Safe Water Temperatures

- Staff will follow provincial regulatory requirements for water temperature checks and record keeping, using the provincially mandated temperature log, or an approved equivalent for documentation.
- **MB specific:** Residents are bathed at least once weekly using their preferred method.

| Safe Water Temperatures | Hot Water Limits |
|------------------------|------------------|
| ON: 40-49˚C (104-120.2°F) | Maximum temperatures: 49°C (120.2°F) for ON/AB and 48°C (118.4°F) for MB. |
| AB: 38-43˚C (100.4-118.4°F) | |
| MB: 43-48˚C (109.4-118.4°F) | |

- If a resident expresses a preference for a lower water temperature than the regulatory standard, this preference must be documented in the resident's care plan and kardex.
- If the hottest flowing water temperature exceeds provincial requirements:
- Staff must immediately report the issue to the Director of Care (DOC) or designate, as well as the maintenance team.
- The affected tub or shower will be tagged out of service until the issue is resolved.
- If a resident indicates that the water temperature is too hot during a bath or shower, staff will immediately assist the residents out of the tub or shower to ensure their safety.
- In the event of a scald or burn, the resident will be immediately assessed and treated appropriately, and the DOC/designate, physician, and substitute decision-maker will be notified promptly.
- Staff will disinfect the tub, shower, shower/bath chair, and all related equipment before and after each resident use, following manufacturer guidelines:
- Spray cold water into the tub interior and all surfaces of the bath chair/equipment.
- Apply approved disinfectant liberally to all surfaces and scrub thoroughly with a tub brush.
- Rinse the tub and bath chair/equipment with clean water.
- After the final bath of the day, soak the tub brush in approved disinfectant for the recommended contact time, then hang it to dry.
