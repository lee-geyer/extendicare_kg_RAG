# Carbapenamase Producing Enterobacterales (CPE)

## Resident Information
Please read this fact sheet and ask staff if you have any questions.

### WHAT IS CPE?
CPE stands for Carbapenamase Producing Enterobacterales. CPE are bacteria (most commonly Klebsiella and E.coli) that have developed resistance to many antibiotics, including penicillin, making an infection of CPE difficult to treat.

### WHAT ARE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF CPE?
Most people who carry CPE have no symptoms of infection and are said to be colonized. The main site of colonization of CPE is the bowel. Infection occurs when CPE enters the body at specific sites and causes symptoms of disease. In infected persons, the signs and symptoms would be related to the site of infection. For example, if the CPE is an E.coli and causes a urinary tract infection (UTI), the signs and symptoms are the same as for any other UTI.

### DOES CPE GO AWAY?
People who have CPE in their bowel will likely carry it for a long time. You do not need treatment unless CPE infection (e.g., pneumonia, UTI) develops.

### HOW CAN THE SPREAD OF CPE BE PREVENTED?
It is possible for a person who is colonized or infected with CPE to spread the bacteria to others. You may be placed on special precautions. This means that the home will take measures to help prevent the bacteria from spreading.

### WHAT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY AND VISITORS?
You may still have visitors. They may be asked to put on gloves and wear a gown over their clothes. This gown should be removed before your visitors leave your room. It is very important that your visitors wash their hands before they leave your room.

### WHAT CAN YOU DO?
- Wash your hands well and frequently.
- Your cooperation with the special precautions in place is most appreciated.
