## POLICY

Extendicare will maintain all health records in a manner that:

1. ensures adherence to legislative privacy obligations with respect to the collection, use, disclosure, secure maintenance and storage, access, correction, and destruction of records;
2. enhances the speed and accuracy of information retrieval by reducing the overall volume of records; and
3. reduces the likelihood of accidental disclosure of sensitive or confidential information.

This policy applies to all health records created by or for Extendicare and its subsidiaries. Health records will be retained and properly destroyed thereafter pursuant to applicable law and Extendicare’s document retention procedures and protocols.

The term “health records” covers all health records in all forms, in both electronic and hard copy, including but not limited to charts, files, memos, reports, drafts, notes, photographs and diagnostic images, microfilm and microfiche, fax, email and other electronically transmitted information.

Originals or copies of health records may not be kept outside of the home, including on personal devices such as home computers.

## STANDARD

### General Health Record Retention

Generally, health records should be kept for the longer of:

1. the period of time specified in the Health Records Retention Table tool; or
2. the period of time for which it is known or reasonably expected that the health records may be required:
- under applicable laws (such as criminal, healthcare and privacy laws);
- for known purposes such as audits, investigations or litigation; or
- pursuant to contractual obligations.

### Health Record Storage and Destruction

Health records must be stored and destroyed after the period of retention, as defined by provincial requirements as set out in the Health Records Destruction procedure. Destruction of health records must be done by shredding, incineration, or deletion. All documents which are culled and/or destroyed will be documented on the Culling & Destruction Tracking Record tool. Homes will use the Guidelines for Culling Records tool to ensure consistency in culling of resident records. Health records retained in offsite storage must be destroyed in accordance with the destruction date applied at the time of storage.
