An interview is often the first opportunity that a resident, family member, or healthcare provider has to share their detailed perspective about the incident. Interviews should be conducted as soon as reasonably possible after an RSI to ensure valuable information is not lost over time.",

This guide provides leaders with tips on how to effectively gather information in the interview step of the investigation.## General Principles\n- Convey compassion, empathy, and respect. - Appreciate that supportive discussion can help staff come to terms with what has happened; conversely, confrontational and judgmental comments may lead to demoralization and defensiveness. - Keep an open mind; there is a natural tendency to accept the first account as accurate and to weigh subsequent versions accordingly.----Helping people live betterThis document is uncontrolled when printed.

Events are not always within the control of the persons involved. Outcomes are not always evident. - Evaluate decisions/actions based on what was going on at the time. - Ask, “How did that make sense at the time?”\n- Avoid oversimplification and jumping to conclusions. Acknowledge complexity.## Note TakingGiven the potential for subsequent legal proceedings, establish the practice of:- Having the same person take notes across all interviews. - Limiting note taking to elements that will help in preparation of a final report (e.g., new facts about the case, issues identified, and suggestions for improvement).",

If not possible, interview in small groups (e.g., 2-3 nurses working the same shift). - Conduct interviews in person, if possible. - Plan to have all members of the review team present for all interviews, if possible.",
