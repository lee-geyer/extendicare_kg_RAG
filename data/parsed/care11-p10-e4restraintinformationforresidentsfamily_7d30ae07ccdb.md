## Restraint Information Sheet for Residents & Family

### Our Purpose
Our purpose is to help people live better. We provide you with a safe and dignified home environment guided by a philosophy of “least restraint.” Our long-term care (LTC) home aims to avoid restraints, as we recognize the potential harm they can cause. We organize our care and services to ensure your safety and security while honouring your right to independence and dignity. Our goal is to create a caring and minimally restrictive atmosphere where you can make choices that support your safety and well-being to the greatest extent possible.

### Resident Rights
You have the right to be informed and consent to specific risks to maintain your independence. Sometimes, a team assessment concludes that restraint is necessary to ensure safety or prevent harm to others. Any use of a restraint must be minimized to the least possible and should allow a person as much freedom of movement and expression as feasible.

### Types of Restraints
- **Physical Restraints:** Limit a person’s movement using devices or equipment (e.g., seatbelt, tabletop/lap tray, tilt feature on a wheelchair when engaged, bedrails).
- **Chemical Restraints:** Psychoactive medication to intentionally prevent specific behaviours or movements.
- **Environmental Restraints:** Control a person’s mobility by changing their surroundings.
- **Personal Assistance Service Device (PASD):** A device to enhance or support a person’s ability to function during activities of daily living (e.g., tabletop/lap tray, tilt wheelchair for repositioning, seatbelt).

### Why do we avoid using restraints?
- **Physical complications** may include pain, skin issues such as abrasions, pressure ulcers, and injury.
- **Psychological effects** include anxiety, depression, confusion, and sensory deprivation can occur.
- **Functional complications** like incontinence, constipation, and increased risk due to muscle strength and balance loss.
- There is a potential for entrapment, drowsiness, and increased mortality.
- Restraints should be used only temporarily and minimized as soon as possible after unsuccessful attempts at prevention, de-escalation, and crisis management strategies.

### How can residents and families help?
Your involvement is crucial to a positive experience.
- Moving into a long-term care home can be challenging. It helps to spend time with family and friends.
- Share what makes a good or bad day for you or your loved ones, such as things that upset them, including early awakenings, hunger, thirst, or pain.
- Bring familiar items or photos from home.
- Take daily walks to support your physical and emotional well-being.
- Ask about and attend care plan meetings with the healthcare team to understand their clinical judgment when evaluating a need for restraint use.

# Restraint Information Sheet for Residents & Family

## Introduction
- Before considering restraints, residents, their families, and healthcare providers will proactively explore alternative strategies (e.g., fall mats, low bed, and bed and chair alarms).
- Participate in the residents’ restraint reduction program or quality committee.

This information sheet informs and empowers residents and their families about the considerations, risks, alternatives, and ethical responsibilities of using restraints in Long-Term Care.

"This information was thoughtfully prepared and reviewed by the Extendicare Clinical Practice team in collaboration with resident and family experience partners from the Resident Experience Action Council for Homes (REACH). Together, we have developed this resource to support you."
