## NERDS: Signs of Superficial Wound Infection

### Mnemonics for Wound Infection
- **Superficial:** Treat Topically
- This tool supports early identification and helps reduce inappropriate antibiotic use.

### Validation of NERDS
Any 3 or more of the following indicate HIGH superficial bacterial infection:
- **Non-healing**
- **Exudate increased**
- **Red friable**
- **Debris**
- **Smell**

| Non-healing                   | Exudate                | Red                   | Debris                   | Smell                     |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Wounds not reduced by 20–40%  | Increased exudate     | Wound bed tissue is   | Presence of discolored   | Unpleasant or sweet,      |

| history or documentation       | inflammation and      | exuberant granulation | slough, and              |                           |
|                               | can cause peri-wound  | tissue. Tissue bleeds | necrotic/nonviable tissue|                           |

# STONEES: Signs of Deeper Wound Infection

## Mnemonics for Deep or Spreading Wound Infection

- **Deep:** Treat Systemically
- This tool supports early identification and helps reduce inappropriate antibiotic use.

## Validation of STONEES

Any 3 or more of the following indicate HIGH bacterial infection in the deep compartment:

| Size Increasing | Temperature Increasing | Os | New | Erythema & Edema | Smell |
|-----------------|-----------------------|----|-----|------------------|-------|
| The wound becomes larger over time instead of shrinking, suggesting delayed healing or infection. | The wound area or surrounding tissue feels warmer than normal, indicating possible infection. | Bone is visible in the wound bed or can be felt with a sterile probe, often signaling deep or severe infection. | New satellite wounds or tissue breakdown appear near the original wound, suggesting spreading infection. | Increased drainage (especially thick or purulent), along with new or worsening redness and swelling, are classic signs of infection and inflammation. | A new or stronger foul odor from the wound often points to bacterial infection. |

## PAIN

New, increased, or altered pain is individually highly indicative of infection.
