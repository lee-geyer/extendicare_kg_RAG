## Resident Information
Please read this fact sheet and ask staff if you have any questions.

### WHAT IS Candida Auris?
Candida auris (also called C. auris) is a fungus that can cause serious infections. It colonizes the skin of the affected individual and can cause infection when the pathogen gains entry into the body through various sites, including the ears, wounds, and the bloodstream. People can carry C. auris somewhere on their body, even if it is not making them sick. This is called colonization.

### HOW DOES C. AURIS SPREAD?
C. auris can spread from one person to another. When residents in long-term care are colonized, C. auris can spread from their bodies and can get on other people by direct contact (unwashed hands). Transmission through indirect contact can also occur after touching contaminated material or equipment. Good hand hygiene and room cleaning is important because C. auris can live on surfaces for several weeks.

- It can cause serious infections.

### WHAT TYPES OF INFECTION DOES C. AURIS CAUSE?
C. auris can cause a variety of infections from superficial (skin) infections to more severe, life-threatening infections. C. auris is the most dangerous when it causes invasive infections, such as bloodstream infections.
