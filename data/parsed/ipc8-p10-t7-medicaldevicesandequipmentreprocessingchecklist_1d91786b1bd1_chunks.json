      "text": "- If the sterilizer does not have a printer, there is a plan to replace it; concurrently, time and temperature are recorded at intervals during each cycle and a Type 5 CI is placed in each package.### 4.2 Biological Indicator Testing- **Sterilizer is tested** with a Biological Indicator (BI) in a process challenge device (PCD) each day the sterilizer is used and with each type of cycle used that day.### 4.3 Control BI Incubation- A control BI from the same lot number as the test BI and unexposed to sterilant is incubated according to the MIFU each day that routine BIs are incubated.### 4.4 Release of Medical Devices/Equipment- Medical devices/equipment are only released when the BI results are available; if quarantine pending BI results is not possible, evaluation of a Type 5 or 6 CI in a PCD and the specific cycle physical parameters are used to justify the release of routine loads.### 4.5 Contingency Plans- There are contingency plans (i.e., implement Recall policy and procedure) in the event of reprocessing failures.### 4.6 Air Removal-Type Sterilizer Testing- If a dynamic air removal-type (i.e., pre-vacuum) sterilizer is used, an air-detection PCD (e.g., Bowie-Dick test pack) is done every day the sterilizer is used in an empty chamber.### 4.7 Drying Processed Packages- Processed packages are allowed to dry inside the sterilizer chamber before removing and handling.### 4.8 Handling Contaminated Packages- Processed packages that are unsealed, damaged, wet, visibly soiled, or have been dropped on the floor are considered contaminated and are reprocessed through the full reprocessing cycle.### 4.9 Checking CIs- Sterilized medical devices/equipment are not used until the CIs are checked.### 4.10 Failed CI Protocol- If a failed CI is found, the contents of the package are to be evaluated.----**Note:** This document is uncontrolled when printed.",
