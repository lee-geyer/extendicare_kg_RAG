It emphasizes the need for training and awareness of the risks involved in using assistive devices.# Key Considerations for Best PracticePatient assessment is crucial to identify the most appropriate equipment for the care task, including selection and fitting of the appropriate sling. In this section, four main areas to consider will be described in more detail.## 1. Patient Characteristics\n- **Condition and specific needs**\n- **Size, morphology, weight**\n- **Mobility level**## 2. Care Activity\n- **Aim and nature of care task**\n- **Efficiency**\n- **Rehab goals**## 3. Lift System\n- **Intended use and compatibility**\n- **Spreader bar and sling attachment**\n- **Sling fabric option**## 4.

Assessing the mobility level of the patient is a leading indicator of the type of lift and sling to be used.

Some may decide to standardize their lift device systems and sling types to increase efficiency and reduce the number of different devices available, with the ultimate aim of promoting consistency in practice and streamlining training. This can help to reduce the occurrence of adverse incidents.----### Document Metadata- **Policy Number:** [Insert Policy Number]\n- **Effective Date:** [Insert Effective Date]\n- **Review Date:** [Insert Review Date]# References1.
