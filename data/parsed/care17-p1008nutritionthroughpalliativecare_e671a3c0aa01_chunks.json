In the early stages, nutritional intervention may be required to support nutritional requirements and individual goals. Towards the end of life, the goal is to maximize food enjoyment and diminish food-related discomfort, which may result in modification of nutrition goals and interventions to support overall comfort and quality of life. - The resident and/or substitute decision maker (SDM)/Power of Attorney (POA) are involved in the discussion of goals of care and nutrition plan of care.",

Documents are available to facilitate discussion (see Education).### Stable and Transitional- Nutrition can provide residents with the energy they need and reduce infection, improving quality of life. Interventions should be chosen to meet individual needs and goals. - Changes to the current plan of care may be appropriate and should be discussed with the resident and/or SDM/POA as well as the interdisciplinary team to ensure alignment. - For residents unable to meet their needs orally, the advanced care planning information should be referenced, if applicable. Discussion with the resident and/or SDM/POA regarding enteral feeding or artificial hydration should encompass both potential benefits and potential negative effects including risk. The nutrition plan for end-of-life should also be discussed at this time.",

Eating and drinking at this time should be for enjoyment rather than nutrition. The focus should be on symptom control, physical care, and psychological and spiritual support.----**Helplng people**\n**Ilve batter**\nThis document is uncontrolled when printed.
