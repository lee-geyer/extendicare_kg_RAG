## Hazard Identification and Risk Analysis (HIRA) Guide and Process

A Hazard Identification Risk Analysis (HIRA) is a systematic risk assessment tool that can be used to assess the risks of various hazards. This approach both satisfies accreditation requirements and allows for a systematic, targeted approach to emergency preparedness. The results of a risk assessment can be used to guide an annual or multi‐year emergency management cycle.

In addition to identifying high‐priority hazards, this proactive approach to emergency management can result in a more disaster‐resilient environment.

Success in meeting this challenge can be found by answering the following questions:

- What hazards exist within or surrounding each site?
- How frequently do they occur?
- How severe can their impact be on the homes’ staff, residents, infrastructure, finances, and reputation?
- Which hazards pose the overall greatest threat to the home/organization?

To address these questions, a comprehensive hazard identification and risk assessment (HIRA) is required.

## RISK ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES

### Step 1: Hazard Identification
The first step in this process is to identify all possible hazards – no matter how unlikely, provided a greater than zero chance – that might impact your home or its surrounding community.

The Risk Assessment Form will be used for this process and the Administrator will lead the process to determine the potential hazards. Once the team has identified the potential hazards at the home, select the threats or list them in the “Threat” column of the form. Use the list below the assessment form to help determine hazards for your home.

### Step 2: Determine the Probability of the Risk
The second process is the Risk Assessment; determining the probability of a potential emergency occurring and the consequence of the emergency should it actually occur.

In the Probability column of the Risk Assessment Form, rate the likelihood of each emergency's occurrence. This is a subjective consideration. Use a simple scale of 1 to 5 with 1 as the lowest probability and 5 as the highest; more information about this scale is on the Risk Assessment Form. This number is then entered into the probability column.

### Step 3: Determine the Consequence of the Risk
Once the probability is determined, the impact or consequence of the emergency is estimated, taking into consideration the potential human consequence (the probability of injuries or death), the potential property (damage, ability to quickly relocate), and the potential business impacts (business interruption, staff unable to report to work, etc.). The impact is based on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 as the lowest impact/consequence and 5 as the highest; more information about this scale is on the Risk Assessment Form. This number is then entered into the consequence column.

# Hazard Identification and Risk Analysis (HIRA) Guide and Process

Distance can be used here to determine relative safety to identified hazards and therefore the impact they may have.

> **Note:** Type and volume of hazard, weather (e.g. wind, rain, temperature inversions), compounding factors (e.g. fire, synergistic chemicals) and protective barriers will all factor into determining a safe distance at the time of an emergency.

Based on safe distances noted in the precautionary evacuation recommendations in Transport Canada’s Emergency Response Guidebook Transport Canada Emergency Response Guidebook, the following estimates would be reasonable:

| Distance Range         | Risk Level               |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Less than 300 metres   | Very high risk of evacuation |
| 300 - 800 metres       | High risk of evacuation   |
| 800 - 1600 metres      | Medium risk of evacuation |
| More than 1600 metres  | Low risk of evacuation    |

For nuclear power plants, a 10 km distance is generally used as the “primary evacuation area.” It should be noted, however, that there has never been an emergency at a nuclear generating station in Canada requiring the evacuation of a 10 km radius. An important part of the assessment is to work closely with operational staff on identifying what they perceive as their concerns at each location, along with an impartial evaluation by the Emergency Planning Team. Some key considerations include:

1. Winter storm and freezing conditions in relation to loss of heat and a rapid cooling of the home.
2. Workplace violence has a far-reaching effect on staff if they do not feel safe within the workplace. The risks may be from residents, resident families, staff, staff family members (e.g. domestic violence), visitors, or unassociated people who enter the home.
3. Fire is always a high priority as it presents life safety concerns if the fire is of a large enough nature.
4. Missing residents in homes is not uncommon. The longer a resident is missing, the increased probability of serious injury, illness, or death.
5. Medical emergencies can occur at any time at any home.
6. Neighborhood risks including violence are a potential concern based on the location of the home (e.g. proximity to a high school, college, or university).
7. Epidemics/pandemics/group illness are potential concerns due to the impact such an incident would have on the work environment and the fact that Canada has encountered 3 significant events in the past 10 years.
8. Unlimited building access, non-existent or poor building security processes pose a potential risk.
9. A lack of communication can increase the level of other risks.

# Hazard Identification and Risk Analysis (HIRA) Guide and Process

## Reporting and Accountability Structure
Although this in itself is not a hazard, if both supervisory and care staff are not trained in the value and need for a strong and unbroken chain of command and accountability, people can be left at risk during an emergency.

## Level of Risk Matrix
### Step 4: Determine the Level of Risk
Using the risk matrix, score the risks by priority. Once probability and consequence have been scored, you can use the risk matrix to assign a score which will help you prioritize the risks for mitigation. The risk matrix can be found on the Risk Assessment Form, and the number and risk level is to be entered into the Priority column.

> **Note:** The level of risk is simply a planning tool, not a scientific determination of what will occur. The highest priority items are addressed first, followed by the medium risks and, where applicable, the low-risk items. You will then develop home level plans to address the unique risks of your home.

## Mitigation Plans
### Step 5: Develop Mitigation Plans for Your Home’s Unique Risks
The purpose of this risk assessment is to identify mitigation and preparedness priorities based on the relative threat each hazard poses. This prioritized list should help to guide and support an annual cycle of emergency management activities.

Prior to progressing, however, each hazard should be assessed for pre-existing risk management strategies already in place, such as Extendicare policies and procedures. In some cases, risk control measures may already be adequate. In others, residual risk may still require further efforts to be taken. Interviews with subject matter experts and review of existing emergency plans is an effective way to make this assessment.

Where it is deemed that new risk management strategies are required, it is recommended that actions be taken to reduce risk working from hazards of highest priority to lowest priority. Where possible, however, an all-hazards approach to mitigation and preparedness should be taken, where the relative risk of multiple hazards can be reduced by a single measure (for example, an extreme weather plan could cover tornados, hurricanes, and severe storms).

### Ways to Decrease Risk
There are two ways of decreasing risk:
- Reducing the likelihood
- Reducing the consequences

Both likelihood and consequence reduction can be achieved through mitigation measures (such as redundancies in case of failure or built-in physical resistance to prevent damage). Consequences can further be reduced through preparedness measures that allow for a more efficient response (such as written plans to guide response, staff training to ensure response is executed effectively, and resource acquisition to support response).

### Primary Ways to Limit Risk
There are three primary ways to limit risk from hazardous materials or situations:
1. Time
2. Distance
3. Protection

# Hazard Identification and Risk Analysis (HIRA) Guide and Process

Risk generally can be reduced with decreased exposure (time), increasing distance between the person and the hazard, and having a protective barrier between the hazard and people. The protective barrier could be the type of construction of a building, personal protective equipment, etc., dependent on the hazard being addressed. An option used by emergency officials is called “sheltering in place” where the building envelope is used as a barrier to protect the occupants. For example, it may be safer to remain indoors than to venture outside into a potential hazardous environment.

In protecting the general population, the most common form of reducing risk is distance created by evacuating an area around the hazard. Under normal circumstances, the further you are from a hazard the safer you are.

## Step 6: File your completed HIRA with your emergency plans.

The HIRA should be updated annually as part of a recurring cycle, with the results serving to assist in the identification of future priorities for emergency preparedness activities.
