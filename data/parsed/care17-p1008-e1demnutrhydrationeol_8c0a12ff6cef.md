# Comfort Feeding/Hand Feeding

Survival rate/prolongation of life with tube feeding may vary from 1 month to a year. People with advanced dementia often don’t understand why the PEG feed has been placed in their stomach and frequently pull it out.

## Nutrition in Dementia

### Comfort Feeding
In comfort feeding, oral food/fluid continues in the appropriate texture. For residents whom oral intake is not recommended due to risk of choking/aspiration, small amounts may be offered for comfort. Residents are offered food at meals, snacks, and as desired. Feeding stops when the resident indicates they are finished or distressed. The goal of care is not weight or fluid maintenance but to make the resident as comfortable as possible. Giving small amounts of food, sips of water, mouth care, or ice chips may be sufficient to lighten hunger and thirst and help to preserve quality of life.

### Artificial Hydration (AH)
Artificial hydration is when liquid is administered through a needle into a vein (IV) or under the skin (hypodermoclysis). Using AH may physically burden the resident by drawing out the dying process to weeks, cause fluid overload, breathing difficulty, and more pain and discomfort. Dehydration is a natural part of the dying process and allows for a more comfortable death over a period of days. Hydration will not make the resident feel better or stronger.

## What about food and fluids at end of life?
Eating less in advanced dementia is expected as a part of the progression to end of life (EOL). At this point, the goal of care is to provide comfort only. Residents at EOL may not be able to swallow safely without choking or aspirating. There is a reduction in appetite and thirst as the body slowly shuts down. Withdrawal of food/fluid when no longer tolerated or desired allows the disease to progress on its natural course.

### Enteral Feeding/Tube Feeding (PEG)
If a resident is unable to meet their needs orally, the family may choose an enteral feed (PEG) as an option to increase the nutrient intake. However, studies do not show that PEG feeding improves nutrition, reduces pain, prevents or heals pressure sores, reduces aspiration or aspiration pneumonia, or extends life. There is a higher risk (50‑70%) of complications such as aspiration, feeding tube obstruction, tube migration, gastro-intestinal bleeding, infection, fluid overload, etc.

# Nutrition in Dementia

## What is Dementia?
Dementia is one of the most common brain disorders among seniors. It is not a specific disease but a collection of symptoms which may affect people differently. Dementia causes memory impairment, difficulties in judgments and reasoning, loss of ability to perform everyday tasks including self‑feeding, changes in moods and behavior. The most common form of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease.

According to Alzheimer Society of Canada (2012), 747,000 Canadians are living with cognitive impairment, including dementia. This will double to 1.4 million by 2031.

## How does dementia affect food and fluid intake?
Behavioural, functional and cognitive impairments in the late stages of dementia can affect food and fluid intake:

- Chewing and swallowing difficulties
- Changes in food preferences/habits
- Reduced or lack of recognition of food/fluids
- Reduced awareness of the purpose of food/fluid (eat to live)
- Increased distraction, agitation, pacing
- Lack of signals of thirst/hunger, smell/taste
- Reduced visual field
- Inability to follow instructions
- Reduced/inability to feed self

Reduced food/fluid intake may lead to weight loss and increased vulnerability to infection, dehydration, and fatigue.

## What can be done when nutrient intake is insufficient?
As a resident’s intake declines, they will be assessed by the Interdisciplinary Team to identify interventions that may improve or maintain food/fluid intake. These interventions may include:

- Texture changes to food/fluid
- Adaptive utensils and plates
- Increased assistance at meals/snacks
- High calorie snacks/beverages
- Commercial supplements

When interventions are not sufficient to meet nutritional needs, or oral intake is deemed “unsafe”, the family/SDM is consulted regarding the nutrition plan of care. This is usually challenging for families as Resident and family wishes, beliefs, values, and religion influence the decision for nutrition support. Generally, the following are considered as the Resident declines towards end of life:
