- Falls (new or more often)

Unless medical status is declining rapidly, push fluids for 24 hours and then reassess:
- If typical symptoms develop, treat as for UTI
- If non-specific symptoms continue without development of typical symptoms, consider an alternate diagnosis
- If symptoms resolve, no further intervention is required
