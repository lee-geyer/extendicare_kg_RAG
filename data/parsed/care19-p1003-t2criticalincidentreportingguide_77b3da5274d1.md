# User Guide for Investigating and Reporting Critical Incidents

## Introduction
This user guide will aid leaders in investigating and reporting critical incidents to their provincial regulatory bodies. This is not an exhaustive list of required actions that can be applied to every scenario. Rather, it is a summary of mandatory fields that all homes must include as part of their investigation and reporting process. Home leaders are required to refer to relevant operational and clinical policies to ensure that all appropriate assessment, referral, and resident needs are met during the management of a critical incident.

### All Extendicare Homes are to:

# Due Diligence in Resident Safety Incidents

Due diligence in a resident safety incident refers to the proactive and thorough steps taken by the home to ensure the safety and well-being of residents. It involves a comprehensive investigation into the incident to identify causes, assess risks, and implement corrective actions to prevent future occurrences. This process includes reviewing safety protocols, inspecting facilities, ensuring compliance with regulations, and taking appropriate measures to mitigate risks. The goal is to demonstrate responsible care and accountability in addressing potential safety concerns and minimizing harm to residents.

## Consider the Following:

### Is there risk to the resident?
- Is an existing diagnosis worsening?
- Does the worsening diagnosis require additional assessments?
- Were there interventions implemented to reduce risk?
- What were the interventions prior to the event and were they followed?
- Were the interventions stated in the plan of care followed?
- Is there a strategy in place to prevent reoccurrence and mitigate future risk?
- Have all the details specific to the event been included in the report?

### Does the report also include:
- Preventative actions for residents, staff, or home.
- All external authorities contacted.
- When these actions will be implemented?
- Update report if outstanding items on the checklist remain; if more than 10 days are required, explain why and expected completion date.
- Failure to provide amendments may result in further action and investigation by inspectors.
- Ensure any attached documents can be opened or viewed.
- Follow documentation standards and avoid the use of abbreviations.
- Collect and keep all investigation notes and evidence in an investigation folder/binder.
- Print off the CIS report and have the Executive Director sign off.
- Keep a CIS binder/folder in an accessible but locked area should MLTC Inspectors request the binder for review.
- If video footage is involved, cut and save the exact footage needed for the investigation.
