## POLICY

### Health Record Management

#### BACKGROUND:
All documentation in health records will provide an accurate description of each resident’s episodes of care and contact with health care personnel. A health record for every resident must be available to assist with assessment and treatment, continuity of care, clinical handover, resident safety and clinical quality improvement, education, research, evaluation, legal, funding, and regulatory and statutory requirements.

- Establish a process for the maintenance of resident health records providing the necessary training for accurate documentation of care, maintenance and storage of paper records, retrieval, and compilation of information.
- Ensure doors that provide entry to areas where there are health records are locked when there is no provider in the area.
- Ensure that all health records are used and stored in a safe and secure manner, preventing unauthorized viewing, and restricting unauthorized access. This includes both paper and electronic records.
- There is a process to monitor and evaluate record-keeping practices, designed with input from residents, families and/or caregivers, and the information is used to make improvements e.g., family care conferences.

### All Staff will:
- Ensure they have knowledge of documentation and management of health records outlined in this procedure and the standards set out in the Standards Related to Health Care Records tool and the Health Records Retention Table tool (PRV-O10.01-T4).
