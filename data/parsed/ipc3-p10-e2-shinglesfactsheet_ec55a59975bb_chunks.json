Shingles is the name commonly used for herpes zoster, an infection that shows up as a painful skin rash with blisters, usually on part of one side of the body (left or right), often in a strip. Shingles is caused by the varicella zoster virus.### How do people get shingles? People get shingles when the virus that causes chicken pox, varicella zoster, is reactivated in their body. The varicella zoster virus doesn’t leave the body, even after a person has recovered from chicken pox. It can flare up again, causing shingles, often many years after a person has had chicken pox. The virus tends to reactivate when a person’s immune system is weakened because of another health problem.### What are the symptoms of shingles? !What a shingles rash looks like.

The rash can occur anywhere on the body, although it is usually in one strip on the right or left side of the body.",

The rash can occur anywhere on the body, although it is usually in one strip on the right or left side of the body. The rash consists of groups of small, fluid-filled blisters that dry, scab over, and heal (like chickenpox) in a few weeks. Healing is usually complete, but some people may be left with scars.### What are the risks associated with shingles? Some people experience pain around the rash site for a month or more—pain that is severe enough to interfere with daily activities.----*Page 1 of 2*\n```This markdown format preserves the document structure, including headers, images, and important information while ensuring readability.# Shingles Information## Overview\nScratching the rash can also cause a secondary infection if harmful bacteria get into the sores.

A health professional can advise who should not be vaccinated due to contraindications to the vaccine.\n- People between 50 and 59 years can request the vaccine from their health professional.## Treatment",
