# POLICY

**SECTION:** Housekeeping
**DESCRIPTION:** Cleaning and Organization
**INDEX:** EVS2-P10

Housekeeping staff will follow written infection prevention and control policies that are based on best practices to ensure sanitation of the home and reduce the risk of cross-contamination.

During an isolation, housekeeping staff will clean isolation rooms regularly according to a cleaning schedule. At the end of the isolation, the Outbreak Management Team will determine whether there is a need for a final clean.

Rooms of residents diagnosed with an active case of Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) will be cleaned twice daily. The room will be cleaned twice (i.e., receive a ‘double clean') on the final cleaning.

All spills of blood or potentially infectious materials must be cleaned up and the area(s) will be decontaminated as soon as is practical. Housekeeping staff, if available, will clean and disinfect the area after all contaminated soils and body fluids have been removed by Nursing staff. Staff must wear appropriate personal protective equipment when cleaning up a spill, including disposable gloves. If the possibility of splash exists, staff must wear protective eyewear and a fluid resistant gown. If Housekeeping staff is not available, Nursing staff will undertake cleaning and disinfecting procedure.

General waste will be removed from all areas of the home every day, at a minimum, to ensure odour control, infection control, and pest control. General waste will be disposed of in a safe way and according to provincial and local regulations.
