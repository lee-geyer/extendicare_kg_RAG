## CORPORATE PANDEMIC PLAN

### Key Terms and Acronyms

#### ACUTE RESPIRATORY INFECTION (ARI)
Acute respiratory infection is an infection that may interfere with normal breathing. It can affect just your upper respiratory system, which starts at your sinuses and ends at your vocal cords, or just your lower respiratory system, which starts at your vocal cords and ends at your lungs.

#### AIRBORNE TRANSMISSION
Refers to the dissemination of either airborne droplet nuclei (small particle residue from evaporated droplets) or dust particles containing the infectious agent. Such microorganisms remain suspended in the air for long periods of time and are widely dispersed by air currents. The microorganisms are inhaled by susceptible hosts, who may be some distance away from the source resident, depending on environmental factors.

#### CDC
Centre for Disease Control and Prevention

#### DIRECT CONTACT TRANSMISSION
Occurs when microorganisms are transferred from direct physical contact between an infected or colonized individual and a susceptible host (skin-to-skin contact).

#### INCIDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (IMS)
Tool that provides a standard framework for responding to internal and external events that require an immediate reordering of daily priorities and deployment of human or material resources.

#### INDIRECT CONTACT TRANSMISSION
Involves the transfer of microorganisms to a susceptible host via an intermediate object (e.g., contaminated instruments, inanimate objects).

#### DROPLET TRANSMISSION
Refers to large droplets (>5μm in size) that are generated when the source resident coughs or sneezes, or during the performance of certain procedures such as bronchoscopy or suctioning. These droplets are propelled a short distance (<2 metres) through the air and are deposited on the mucous membranes of the nose or mouth and possibly eyes of the new host.

#### DROPLET AND CONTACT PRECAUTIONS
Precautions designed to reduce the transmission of disease spread by contact with respiratory secretions generated by sneezing, coughing, laughing, or speaking.

#### EXPOSURE
Contamination with potentially body fluids or secretions by contact with mucous membranes, broken skin, or inhalation of aerosols.

#### ACUTE RESPIRATORY INFECTION (ARI) SCREENING
A routine process by which specific respiratory-related questions are asked to residents, staff, or visitors.

# HAND HYGIENE

Hand hygiene with liquid soap and running water (normally a minimum of 15 seconds contact time with soap) or use of alcohol-based hand rub (70% alcohol, isopropanol or ethanol alcohol) for 15 seconds.

## HIERARCHY OF CONTROLS

The hierarchy of controls consists of engineering controls, administrative and work practices, and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).

1. **Engineering controls** are the first and most effective line of defense because they involve permanent changes in the health care setting that reduce exposure to infectious agents and eliminate the risk of “human error” or non-compliance with recommended practices or use of Personal Protective Equipment.
2. **Administrative and work practices** include ways of organizing and providing care and services — at the system level and the individual organization level — that reduce the risk of exposure.
3. **Personal Protective Equipment** refers to equipment worn to prevent the transmission of disease while in contact with residents with transmissible disease.

## INFLUENZA-LIKE ILLNESS (ILI)

Acute onset of respiratory illness with fever and cough, and one or more of the following: sore throat, arthralgia, myalgia, or prostration, which could be due to the influenza virus. In children under five, gastrointestinal symptoms may also be present. In persons under five or 65 and older, fever may not be prominent.

## ISOLATION

Limiting a resident's movement and social contacts when he/she has an active infectious disease or is the carrier of an infectious disease.

## MODES OF TRANSMISSION

Routes of transmission of infectious agents have been classified as contact, droplet, airborne, fomites, and vector borne. Contact is the most common route of transmission of infectious microorganisms from symptomatic or asymptomatic residents. Droplet transmission is also common for residents with active respiratory symptoms. Airborne occurs less frequently, and vector borne transmissions are rare.

## ACRONYMS

- **PHAC**: Public Health Agency of Canada
- **PIDAC**: Provincial Infectious Diseases Advisory Committee (committee reports to the Chief Medical Officer of Health for Ontario)
- **PPE**: Personal Protective Equipment refers to equipment worn to prevent the transmission of disease while in contact with residents with transmissible disease.
- **QUARANTINE**: Separating and restricting the movement of people who are not ill but have been exposed to an infectious disease.

# ROUTINE PRACTICES

Routine practices are methods which are used regularly to protect ourselves when there is potential for contact with blood or body fluids. We cannot always tell if a person has an infection, so we must treat all blood and body fluids as potentially infectious. Body fluids can include feces, urine, vomit, nasal secretions, sputum, saliva, vaginal secretions, wound drainage, etc.

# Introduction

Pandemics spread around the world. A pandemic is distinguished by its scope. It becomes a worldwide epidemic, or pandemic, when a disease spreads easily and rapidly through many countries and regions of the world and affects a large percentage of the population where it spreads.

A pandemic starts when a new infectious disease emerges that is different from common strains. Because people have no immunity to the new virus, it can spread quickly and infect hundreds of thousands of people. Pandemic viral infections often develop when an animal or bird virus is transmitted to humans and then the virus develops so that it can travel from human to human.

The novel virus will have to be studied to determine the incubation period and how virulent the virus is. The length of time that the virus is contagious will vary as well. A pandemic virus can appear very similar to seasonal infections that already occur in our populations. Because people may have little or no immunity to this novel virus, the spread of the disease can occur with devastating effects on the population. The symptoms can be similar to influenza: fever, headache, aches and pains, chills, fatigue, stuffy nose, sneezing, sore throat, and cough.

An acute respiratory illness (ARI) is spread when someone with the infection coughs or sneezes, and droplets containing the virus come in contact with another person’s nose, mouth, or eyes. It can also be spread by coughing or sneezing into their hands and contaminating things they touch, such as a door handle. Other people can become infected if they touch the same object and then touch their face.

As we know, a pandemic may last globally as long as eighteen months in several waves with mortality and morbidity increasing/decreasing sporadically. Waves of severe disease may last for up to 4 months.

# Background

Advanced planning for a large scale and widespread health emergency is required to optimize service delivery during a pandemic. Unlike other public welfare emergencies, a pandemic will impact multiple programs across our provinces simultaneously. Therefore, contingency planning is required to mitigate the impact of a pandemic through planning, preparation, and collaboration.

This Pandemic Plan has a national scope and its purpose is to provide the staff and management of our Extendicare sites with guidelines for the preparedness and response to a pandemic. Our sites will work in collaboration with federal, provincial, municipal, health/community care, and other agencies to plan and respond to a pandemic crisis.

> **Note:** For the purpose of this pandemic plan document, “sites” refers to all Extendicare and Extendicare Assist physical locations including all corporate offices.

# PURPOSE

All sites together with the Federal and Provincial governments and regional Public Health Authorities believe in a pro-active approach towards creating a community-wide, regional,
```

# Provincial and Organization Pandemic Plan

This plan is to be included in the site’s Emergency Preparedness/Disaster Plan. The purpose of the plan is to:

- Minimize serious illness and death through infection prevention and control practices and protocols;
- Minimize disruptions in care and services to our residents;
- Ensure that all staff members are prepared to provide care and services safely to our residents;
- Maintain the health of residents and staff members during a pandemic;
- Maintain the consistent operation and business function of our Corporate offices, LTC Homes, and Retirement Homes.

# Planning

## PLANNING ASSUMPTIONS

Extendicare’s four key strategies for preparation of and during a pandemic are:
- **READINESS**: Planning and preparation at our corporate offices and in all our sites in anticipation of a potential pandemic.
- **WATCHFULNESS**: Practising active screening and surveillance in all our LTC Homes, Retirement communities, and Home Care settings to identify the earliest signs of a possible outbreak.
- **DECISIVENESS**: Managing the spread of an outbreak quickly and effectively.
- **TRANSPARENCY**: Ongoing communications with Corporate, LTC Homes, Retirement Communities, and Home Care staff, residents, and families.

An Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI) pandemic outbreak will affect the entire health care system in many communities. Health care facilities will have limited capacity. Our sites may not have the same level of support from other health care services in the community.

Pandemic Plans must be coordinated with the plans of other organizations in the community and with the local/regional plans.

The number of health care workers available to provide care may be reduced by up to one-third for a variety of reasons. Usual sources of supplies may be disrupted or unavailable. A vaccine may not be available for at least 18-24 months after the pandemic strain is identified. When available, it will be in short supply.

Extendicare will have to rely on traditional infection prevention and control practices, e.g., hand hygiene, appropriate personal protective equipment, physical distancing, isolation, and cohorting staff and residents as the main line of defense.

To meet community needs during a pandemic, resources including staff, supplies, and equipment may have to be reassigned or shifted. Care protocols may change, and practices may have to be adapted as the pandemic evolves.

Extendicare will need effective ways to communicate with residents' families and friends, in order to meet their needs for information but reduce the demands on staff. Accurate reporting and early diagnosis are essential. Reporting will include all signs and symptoms in order to determine if another strain of the virus is developing.

To reduce the risk to staff of acquiring an acute respiratory illness in the workplace, our health care settings are expected to:
- Ensure all staff have the education, training, and supervision they need to protect themselves and provide effective care.
- Institute appropriate occupational health and infection prevention and control measures.
- Provide appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).

# Pandemic Planning Document

This plan is based on and reflects the pandemic planning and direction from the following:

- **World Health Organization (WHO)**
- **Public Health Agency of Canada**
- **Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan (CPIP)**

As Extendicare has sites in multiple provinces, there is a requirement for each site to follow their province’s provincial Pandemic Plan in addition to Extendicare’s Pandemic Plan:

- **Alberta**: Alberta Pandemic Plan
- **Manitoba**: Manitoba Pandemic Plan
- **Ontario**: Ontario Pandemic Plan

## Legislative Authorities

### WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION: WHO Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response

In order to assist with pandemic planning, the World Health Organization (WHO) has developed the phases of a pandemic. These are widely used in pandemic planning around the world to help guide the planning response.

| PHASE   | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Phase 1 | No new influenza subtypes have been detected in humans. An influenza virus subtype that has caused human infection may be present in animals. If present in animals, the risk of human infection is considered low.            |
| Phase 2 | Virus circulating among domesticated or wild animals is known to have caused infection in humans and is therefore considered a potential pandemic threat.                                                                        |
| Phase 3 | An animal or human-animal influenza reassortment virus has caused sporadic cases or small clusters of disease in people but has not resulted in human-to-human transmission sufficient to sustain community-level outbreaks. Limited human-to-human transmission may occur under some circumstances, for example, when there is close contact between an infected person and an unprotected caregiver. However, limited transmission under such restricted circumstances does not indicate that the virus has gained the level of transmissibility among humans necessary to cause a pandemic. |
| Phase 4 | Is characterized by verified human-to-human transmission of an animal or human-animal influenza reassortment virus able to cause “community-level outbreaks.” The ability to cause sustained disease outbreaks in a community is a key indicator of a pandemic. |

# Pandemic Phases and Guidance

## Phase Descriptions

### Phase 4
- Community marks a significant upwards shift in the risk for a pandemic.
- Any country that suspects or has verified such an event should urgently consult with WHO so that the situation can be jointly assessed.
- A decision made by the affected country if implementation of a rapid pandemic containment operation is warranted.
- Phase 4 indicates a significant increase in risk of a pandemic but does not necessarily mean that a pandemic is a forgone conclusion.

### Phase 5
- Characterized by human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region.
- While most countries will not be affected at this stage, the declaration of Phase 5 is a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent.
- The time to finalize the organization, communication, and implementation of the planned mitigation measures is short.

### Phase 6
- The pandemic phase is characterized by community level outbreaks in at least one other country in a different WHO region in addition to the criteria defined in Phase 5.
- Designation of this phase will indicate that a global pandemic is underway.

## Post-Peak Period
- During the post-peak period, pandemic disease levels in most countries with adequate surveillance will have dropped below peak observed levels.
- The post-peak period signifies that pandemic activity appears to be decreasing; however, it is uncertain if additional waves will occur and countries will need to be prepared for a second wave.
- Previous pandemics have been characterized by waves of activity spread over months.
- Once the level of disease activity drops, a critical communications task will be to balance this information with the possibility of another wave.
- Pandemic waves can be separated by months and an immediate “at-ease” signal may be premature.

## Post-Pandemic Period
- In the post-pandemic period, influenza disease activity will have returned to levels normally seen for seasonal influenza.
- It is expected that the pandemic virus will behave as a seasonal influenza A virus.
- At this stage, it is important to maintain surveillance and update pandemic preparedness and response plans accordingly.
- An intensive phase of recovery and evaluation may be required.

World Health Organization

### Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) – Guidance for Canada
To help guide pandemic planning and response in Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada has developed a numbering system to reflect pandemic activity in Canada. The Canadian activity level number is used in conjunction with the WHO phase number to confirm the level of pandemic activity in Canada:

| Canadian Activity Level | Description                          |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 0                       | Indicates no activity in Canada      |
| 1                       | Indicates low activity and low risk in Canada |
| 2                       | Indicates higher activity and risk in Canada |

# Emergency Management in Canada

Emergency Management in Canada is organized into five stages:

| STAGE        | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Prevention | Involves activities taken to prevent or avoid an emergency or disaster. The eradication of smallpox is an example of a prevention strategy.                                                                                     |
| 2. Mitigation | Involves actions that can reduce the impact of an emergency or disaster. Influenza immunization and infection prevention and control measures are health-specific examples of mitigation. They will not prevent a pandemic, but they may lessen its impact by reducing disease transmission. |
| 3. Preparedness | Involves measures that are put in place before an emergency occurs that will enhance the effectiveness of response and recovery activities, such as developing plans, tools and protocols; establishing communication systems; conducting training; and testing response plans. |
| 4. Response   | Involves the coordinated actions that would be undertaken to respond to an emergency or disaster.                                                                                                                                 |
| 5. Recovery   | Involves activities that help communities recover from an emergency or disaster and return to a state of normalcy. This includes activities to repair damage, rebuild infrastructure, restore services, provide financial assistance, and the ongoing treatment and care for the sick or injured. This stage may also include prevention/mitigation measures designed to avert a future emergency (e.g., vaccination to prevent a future outbreak). The recovery phase also applies to those involved in response who need time to recuperate and renew themselves. |

> **Note:** Sites will also follow the direction of their Provincial and local Public Health Authorities.

## Roles and Responsibilities in a Pandemic

The World Health Organization (WHO) is responsible for coordinating a global response to a pandemic, including:
- Establishing the phases for pandemic planning and making recommendations about how all jurisdictions should plan for and manage a pandemic.
- Declaring a pandemic.

The Government of Canada is responsible for coordinating the nation-wide response, including:

----

**Page 10 of 37**

# Roles and Responsibilities in a Pandemic

## Federal Government Responsibilities
- Communicating with the World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control, and other national/international organizations to coordinate surveillance, investigation, and vaccine activities.
- Confirming pandemic activity in Canada.
- Procuring/distributing diagnostic reagents and technical information to provincial/territorial public health laboratories.
- Research to develop a new vaccine.
- Establishing a domestic vaccine manufacturing capacity.
- Acquiring vaccine and antiviral drugs and allocating them equitably.
- Providing vaccine and antiviral drugs to specific populations for which the federal government is responsible (e.g., First Nations, RCMP, military personnel).

The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) has developed the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan for the health sector, which describes the actions the federal government will take and sets out expectations for the provinces and territories.

## Provincial Government Responsibilities
The Provincial Government is responsible for planning and managing the response to a pandemic in the province, including:
- Implementing national recommendations for surveillance and immunization programs.
- Maintaining provincial surveillance activities, reporting diseases caused by the novel virus, and participating in national surveillance activities.
- Coordinating investigations of outbreaks and clusters of acute respiratory infection (ARI)/influenza-like illness (ILI).
- Confirming pandemic activity in the province.
- Undertaking tasks most effectively done at the provincial level (e.g., bulk purchasing equipment, stockpiling and distributing medical supplies, distributing vaccine and antivirals).
- Providing guidelines and direction to local public health authorities and the health care system to ensure a consistent response across the province.
- Supporting special studies to enhance the province's capacity to manage a pandemic.
- Coordinating public education programs.

## Municipal Government and Local Public Health Authorities Responsibilities
Municipal government and local public health authorities are responsible for coordinating the local response to a pandemic, including:
- Maintaining a local surveillance system, reporting clusters of ARI/ILI, and investigating outbreaks.
- Confirming pandemic activity locally.
- Developing plans to provide mass immunization and distribute vaccines, antiviral drugs, and medical supplies.
- Liaising with local partners (e.g., emergency responders, hospitals, community services, mortuary services, schools, workplaces).
- Assessing the capacity of local health services, including health human resources, and helping health services identify additional/alternative resources.
- Defining clear responsibilities for communication at the local and facility level during a pandemic.
- Collaborating with the provincial government to deliver public information/education programs.
- Delivering mass vaccination/prophylaxis programs.

----

**Page 11 of 37**

# Pandemic Coordinating Plan

Each local health unit will have a pandemic coordinating plan that will set out the steps that local healthcare organizations/services should take to prepare for and respond to a pandemic.

## Pre-Pandemic Planning: Corporate Office Support

### HUMAN RESOURCES

#### Restricting Workplace Entry of Staff with Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI) Symptoms

- Should there be a pandemic risk, sites will post notices at all entry points advising staff and visitors not to enter if they have any respiratory symptoms.
- If a person feels ill, or if someone observes that another person is exhibiting symptoms at work, they are to contact their direct Manager.

#### Increasing Social Distancing

Social distancing means minimizing human-to-human contact in peak phases of the pandemic. Contacts are those persons who have had close (less than 2 meters/6 feet) physical or confined airspace contact with an infected person within 3 days of that person developing symptoms. These are likely to include family members and/or living companions/workmates (if in confined workspace environments) and possibly recreational companions.

To increase social distancing, the following measures should be taken:

- Avoid face-to-face meetings; minimize meeting times; meet in large rooms.
- Avoid unnecessary travel.
- Cancel or postpone non-essential meetings/workshops/training sessions; leave a gap between shifts, where applicable.
- Ventilate the workplace between shifts, where possible.
- Avoid employees gathering in cafeterias and restaurants; introduce staggered lunch times.
- Use communications and network technologies and devices to communicate, including working-at-home remotely.

#### Staff Travel

Should a pandemic be declared in Canada, staff might be asked to cancel any business/travel plans and/or put future travel plans on hold. Should Extendicare feel it is necessary to issue a “no travel” advisory for staff, this information will be disseminated to all staff.

If you are a staff member and have returned from a country that is affected by a pandemic, you may be asked to stay at home.

----

**Page 12 of 37**

# HUMAN RESOURCES

## Working at Home
During a peak period of a pandemic, all staff and volunteers who are considered “non-essential” will be asked to work from home. Your direct manager will advise you if you should work at home or not.

## Employee (Self) ARI Screening
All employees receive information on routine self-ARI Screening at orientation. Routine self-ARI Screening is an ongoing, daily process for employees who work directly with residents. If a staff member fails a routine self-ARI Screen, they must contact their manager immediately for further direction.

In the event of a pandemic, enhanced ARI Screening practices may be necessary which are specifically related to an infectious disease. The IMS team will provide information to sites and employees regarding the enhancements.

## Employee Exposure to Pandemic Illness/Staff Quarantine
During a pandemic, it is likely that employees may be exposed to a pandemic illness either through their work with residents or from the community. Any reported employee exposures must be reported to the Occupational Health and Safety department by the Supervisor. Further direction will be provided from Extendicare’s People and Culture (P&C) division and Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) department related to:

- Eligibility for Short Term Disability
- Requirements for Return to Work forms
- Length of time that is required to be off work

# FINANCE

The adverse economic effects of a pandemic could be significant, locally, provincially, and nationally. The Extendicare Finance Continuity Plan will serve as a guide to maintaining operational stability during times of emergency, disaster, pandemic, or unforeseen events;

- Facilitate timely, responsible decision making and communication process
- Minimize risk to residents, staff, and the organization
- Reduce disruption to billing, payroll, and accounts payable processing
- Monitor/track cash flow and emergency expenditures
- Protect essential equipment, records, and other assets

It is expected that all substantial pandemic-related expenditures will be discussed in collaboration between the Senior Leadership Team and the Finance Department prior to any transactions occurring. Specialized coding may be required in order to identify emergency expenditures during a state of pandemic. Issues that may have a substantial financial impact during a pandemic include but are not limited to:

- Staff absenteeism
- WSIB/exposure/quarantine management
- Reduction of program services
- Increase in PPE purchase requirements
- Staff training requirements
- Hiring/Orientation demands
- EAP
- Legal

# Essential Services and Services that can be curtailed during a Pandemic

During a pandemic, staff will likely be in short supply; they will have to focus on delivering essential services.

## Services that MUST be maintained to provide care and protect residents/clients' health

- life-maintaining medications and treatment
- basic bathing, peri-care and mouth-care
- changing of linens as needed only
- basic laundry services e.g. towels, face cloths, bed linens & pajamas
- dietary services for fluids and nutrition
- Housekeeping and enhanced disinfection
- Physiotherapy
- Occupational Therapy

## Services that can be reduced or curtailed

- Appointments
- Recreational activities
- Hairdressing
- Foot-care for non-diabetics
- Personal laundry

## Outside services scheduled to come in that are essential and those that can be postponed or provided remotely

- Pastoral Care
- Oxygen supplier
- Family member visiting a resident who is imminently dying
- Repair company for emergencies
- Blood work/lab technicians
- Doctors, Nurse Practitioners

All others can be postponed unless the pandemic lasts a long time, then re-assessment of essential needs must be determined.

## Surveillance: Detecting & Monitoring

### SURVEILLANCE

Surveillance is the continuous and systematic process of collecting, analyzing, interpreting and disseminating descriptive information to monitor public health and ensure timely interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality.

Surveillance is the essential component of any effective infection, prevention and control program.

----

**Essential Services and Services that can be curtailed**                      Page 21 of 37

# SURVEILLANCE

It is unlikely that the spread of a pandemic strain will first be detected in our sites; however, because residents/clients are highly vulnerable, a pandemic could spread quickly and easily from the community to the site.

## Purpose

Surveillance is our sites’ primary function. A strong surveillance program will ensure early identification of a potential outbreak or an outbreak in its early stages so that control measures can be instituted as soon as possible to protect residents/clients and staff.

## Responsibility for Surveillance

- **Infection Control Practitioner**
- **Registered Staff** on every shift including weekends and holidays.

## Target Groups for Surveillance

- **Residents/Clients**
- **Staff**
- **Students**
- **Volunteers**
- **Family/Friends**
- **Visitors**

## ARI Surveillance

Surveillance for an ARI must be ongoing throughout the year and increased as flu season progresses. If a pandemic is declared in the province, respiratory screening for all staff and essential visitors is required.

## Resident/Client Surveillance

LTC homes are required to do continuous site-wide surveillance to establish baseline levels of infection throughout the year. Infection rates above the baseline may indicate an outbreak or the arrival of the pandemic strain in the site.

## Ongoing Surveillance Program

The ongoing surveillance program includes:

- Screening of all new admissions as directed by Health Authority.
- Ongoing assessment of residents for signs and symptoms as per case definition(s).
- Testing will be required to determine the causative agent when symptoms are identified.
- The Infection Control Professional or delegate reports any potential outbreak to the Public Health Unit.

## Staff, Student & Volunteer Surveillance

Conducted throughout the year:

- Ensure all staff, students, and volunteers are aware of early signs & symptoms of the infection.
- Clear expectation that you will not come into work when ill (this policy may change during a Pandemic).
- All are expected to report illnesses to the DOC or delegate, confidentiality ensured.

----

**Surveillance: Detecting & Monitoring**
**Page 22 of 37**

# SURVEILLANCE

Clusters will be reported to the Public Health Unit and to the Joint Occupational Health & Safety Committee. Any occupationally acquired infection must be reported to the Ministry of Labour (Ontario) following Provincial legislation.

## Family Members and Visitor (including contractors)

Anyone entering or carrying on activities within this facility must be screened (active or passive) for symptoms of ARI each time they enter. Signs and hand hygiene stations are to be posted at all entrances instructing family members and visitors to:

- Perform hand hygiene
- Self/active screen for symptoms of ARI (new cough, new shortness of breath, fever) as per Ministry guidelines
- Not to enter if they have respiratory symptoms
- Ask to sign in and out in order to maintain a record in the event of an emergency or outbreak

## Staff Contingency Plan

### Optimizing Deployment of the Workforce:

- To identify the skills and competencies required to provide care
- To provide tools that can be used to assess skills

Competencies are defined as the skills, knowledge, and judgment required to deliver a particular health care service. A competency-based approach identifies the competencies required and the competencies available to deliver the services that people need during an influenza pandemic.

Up to 20-50% absenteeism from work, vendors, and services within our sector may occur. Absenteeism will be the result of staff becoming ill, staying home to care for others, or refusal to go to work. Ill staff will be directed by Public Health as to the length of time they need to remain off work. Behavioral change may occur during a pandemic – staff may limit their activities and choose to avoid others. They may become fearful, angry, or opportunistic. Staff with secondary jobs will be required to choose between employers.

### Inventory

- Identify required supplies/alternative supply chains
- The site should have an Inventory Tracking Sheet
- Traditional supply chains may be disrupted
- Establish relationships with alternative suppliers/sources

----

**Staff Contingency Plan**
Page 23 of 37

# Supplier List

The site should have a list prepared of the following suppliers and an alternate supplier. See the following format:

| Supplies Required                       | Supplier              | Alternate Supplier |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Equipment suppliers                     |                       |                    |
| Food suppliers                          |                       |                    |
| Pharmacies                              |                       |                    |
| Oxygen suppliers                        |                       |                    |
| Attending physicians                    |                       |                    |
| Coroner                                 |                       |                    |
| Medical Supplies                        |                       |                    |
| Incontinence Products                   |                       |                    |
| Environmental (cleaning and laundry)    |                       |                    |

## Economic/Legal Implications

Economic/legal implications due to the pandemic may occur including:

- Staff overtime/km compensation
- Unable to provide service
- Unable to meet contractual obligations
- Unforeseen purchases may be necessary
- Replacement products may be at a higher cost
- Critical functions carried out by external contractors, consultants, and vendors may be erratic and limited (technology, delivery services, suppliers, contractors, etc.)

## Security and Physical Plant

Sites may require additional or different security procedures to lock down the site and/or to safeguard supplies. To make provisions to manage traffic flow into and within the sites, the following measures may be implemented:

- Entry to the building will be only through the main entrance.
- Staff exit from the building will be the main entrance.
- Essential visitors exit from the building will be through the main entrance.
- All people except staff who enter the building are required to sign the register and sign out when leaving.
- All people who enter the building will be required to screen as per public health screening criteria and guidelines.

# Immunization

## IMMUNIZATION STATUS

### Residents
At Extendicare, we recommend all residents receive annual influenza vaccines and COVID vaccines unless contraindicated. We also offer residents Tetanus diphtheria and pertussis (T-DAP) vaccinations. The immunization record of the resident shall be retained in their individual plan of care. If the resident is being transferred, the receiving health care facility must be informed about their immunization status along with their transfer sheet and an outbreak notification form.

### Staff and Volunteers' Immunization Status
Extendicare has an annual influenza immunization campaign, and all staff are encouraged to participate. Extendicare has a policy that requires the COVID-19 primary series vaccination as a condition of employment. All staff are encouraged to get their boosters when eligible, and in-home clinics are offered where able.

## Education
Preparedness will include ongoing education of staff, volunteers, residents, and families regarding the site's pandemic plan. A significant amount of information will focus on infection prevention and control practices and measures to protect the health of staff and residents. The site's Director of Care (DOC) or designate and the Infection Control Practitioner (ICP) are responsible for developing education plans and providing training.

### Education Plans must include:
- The person/position responsible for the training/education program: DOC or designate & ICP.
- The education required for staff, including staff who do not routinely care for residents but might have to during a pandemic.
- Education for volunteers.
- Education required for residents, Residents' Council, families, and the Family Council, which may include training family members to assist with some aspects of care during a pandemic (e.g., bed baths, feeding & toileting).
- Education for visitors.
- Methods for training staff and volunteers quickly for new and altered roles (e.g., job descriptions and duties sheets developed and available).
- Approaches to training (e.g., team-based approaches will ensure any temporary workers receive appropriate support and supervision, and cross-training to ensure staff are able to cover one another's duties).

----

**Page 25 of 37**

# Frequency of Training
- e.g. during orientation, then annually. This may occur more frequently if threat of pandemic is imminent.
- Every effort will be made to ensure that education provided by the sites is consistent with that provided by other sites and health care organizations in the community and province.

## Education Programs
The importance of hand hygiene and proper hand hygiene techniques should include:
- Appropriate cleaning and disinfection of equipment, i.e., any equipment that is shared between residents must be cleaned and disinfected after each use.
- Appropriate use of PPE which includes application, removal, and disposal of gloves, gowns, eye protection, and surgical masks.
- Risks associated with infectious diseases.
- Staff conducting risk assessments.
- Benefits of case finding/surveillance.
- Principles and components of routine infection control practices.
- Risks of transmission.
- Procedures that are considered high risk and why.
- Individual staff responsibility to keep other staff and residents safe.
- Employer's responsibility to protect workers' health.
- Risks, benefits, and myths regarding immunization.
- Changes to exclusion policies during a pandemic and why.

# Ethical Considerations
Ethical considerations need to be made ahead of time regarding:
- Which services will be provided.
- How services will be provided.
- Who will be allowed into the site.
- How limited resources will be used.

## Individual Liberty/Protection of the Public from Harm (i.e., isolation)
They will also ensure that all those involved are aware of the medical and ethical reasons for these measures, the benefits of complying, and the consequences of not complying.

## Proportionality
Restrictions on individual liberty and measures to protect the public from harm should not exceed the minimum required to address the actual level of risk or need in the community. Sites will use the least restrictive or coercive measures possible when limiting or restricting liberties or entitlements.

## Privacy
Individuals have a right to privacy, including the privacy of their health information. During a pandemic, it may be necessary to override this right to protect the public from serious harm; however, to be consistent with the ethical principle of proportionality, sites will limit any disclosure to only information required to meet legitimate public health needs.

----

**Ethical Considerations**
**Page 26 of 37**

# Health Information

## Equity
During a pandemic, sites will strive to preserve as much equity as possible between the needs of residents with influenza and residents who need care for other diseases, and to establish fair decision-making processes/criteria. When sites have to identify residents and staff who will have priority access to antivirals, vaccines, or other treatment, they will ensure that everyone is aware of the criteria used to make those decisions (see tables). They will also be aware of the impact that these decisions may have on the site.

## Duty to Provide Care/Reciprocity
Health care workers have an ethical duty to provide care and respond to suffering. During a pandemic, demands for care may overwhelm health care workers and their institutions and create challenges related to resources, professional practice, liability, and workplace safety. Health care workers may have to weigh their duty to provide care against competing obligations (i.e., their own health, family, and friends). To support staff in their efforts to discharge their duty to provide care, sites will strive to ensure the appropriate supports are in place (e.g., resources, supplies, equipment), provide support for staff to fulfill their personal/family responsibilities, take steps to ease the burden on staff and their families, and establish a mechanism to deal with staff concerns and work exemptions.

## Trust
Trust is an essential part of the relationship between organizations and their staff, between the public and health care workers, and among organizations within a health system. Sites will take steps to build trust with staff, families, and other organizations before the pandemic occurs and to ensure decision-making processes are ethical and transparent.

## Solidarity
A pandemic will require solidarity among community, health care institutions, local public health units, and government. Solidarity requires good, straightforward communication and open collaboration to share information and coordinate health care delivery.

## Stewardship
Sites will be entrusted with governance over scarce resources, such as vaccines, antivirals, equipment, and health care workers. To ensure good stewardship of scarce resources, sites will consider both the benefit to the public good and equity (i.e., fair distribution of both benefits and burdens). As part of stewardship, sites will determine how resources will be allocated for residents who are at end of life.

## Respect for Cultural Diversity/Beliefs
Sites will strive to continue to respect residents' cultural values and religious beliefs throughout a pandemic.

----

**Ethical Considerations**
**Page 27 of 37**

# Infection Control

## INFECTION CONTROL – TRANSMISSION

The primary strategies for preventing pandemic spread are the same as those for all communicable diseases:

- Vaccination if available
- Early detection and treatment with antiviral medications if available
- The use of infection control measures to prevent transmission during the provision of care

When a pandemic begins, a vaccine may not yet be available, and a supply of antiviral drugs may be limited. The ability to limit transmission will, therefore, rely heavily on the appropriate and thorough application of infection control measures.

While it is commonly accepted that an acute respiratory illness transmission requires close contact—via exposure to large droplets (droplet transmission), direct contact (contact transmission), or near-range exposure to aerosols if performing certain procedures (airborne transmission)—the relative clinical importance of each of these modes of transmission is essential.

Given some uncertainty about the characteristics of a new pandemic strain, all aspects of preparedness planning for a pandemic must allow for flexibility and real-time decision-making that take new information into account as the situation unfolds.

The specific characteristics of a new pandemic virus—virulence, transmissibility, initial geographic distribution, clinical manifestation, risk to different age groups and sub-populations, and drug susceptibility—will remain unknown until the pandemic gets underway. If the new virus is unusual in any of these respects, updated infection control guidance will be provided.

### Transmission

Early in a pandemic, it may not be clear that a resident with acute respiratory infection (ARI) has the novel virus. Therefore, precautions consistent with all possible etiologies, including a newly emerging infectious agent, should be implemented. This may involve the combined use of airborne and droplet/contact precautions, in addition to routine practices, until a diagnosis is established.

### Mode of Transmission

Transmission from person to person is generally consistent with spread through close contact (i.e., exposure to large respiratory droplets, direct contact, or near-range exposure to aerosols). There may be some evidence of airborne transmission over long distances or prolonged periods of time dependent on exposure, activities of provider, and displayed resident symptoms.

### Droplet Transmission

Droplet transmission involves contact of the conjunctivae or the mucous membranes of the nose or mouth of a susceptible person with large-particle droplets containing micro-organisms generated from a person who has a clinical disease or who is a carrier of the micro-organism. Droplets are generated from the source person primarily during coughing, sneezing, or talking and during the performance of certain procedures such as suctioning. Transmission via large-particle droplets requires close contact between source and recipient persons, because droplets do not remain suspended in the air and generally travel only short distances (about a 2 metre perimeter) through the air. Because droplets do not remain suspended in the air, special precautions should be taken.

----

**Infection Control**
Page 28 of 37

# Infection Control Protection During a Pandemic Influenza

## Transmission Modes

### Contact Transmission
- Contact transmission may occur through either direct skin-to-skin contact or through indirect contact with virus in the environment.
- Transmission via contaminated hands and fomites (contaminated inanimate objects).
- **Direct-contact transmission** involves:
- Skin-to-skin contact
- Physical transfer of microorganisms to a susceptible host from an infected or colonized person, such as when staff position/transfer a resident, bathe resident, or perform other resident-care activities that require physical contact.
- Direct-contact transmission can also occur between two residents (e.g., by hand contact), with one serving as the source of infectious microorganisms and the other as a susceptible host.

- **Indirect-contact transmission** involves:
- Contact of a susceptible host with a contaminated intermediate object, usually inanimate, in the resident’s environment.

### Airborne Transmission
- Airborne transmission occurs by dissemination of either airborne droplet nuclei or small particles containing the infectious agent.
- Micro-organisms carried in this manner may be dispersed over longer distances by air currents and may be inhaled by susceptible individuals who have not had face-to-face contact with (or been in the same room with) the infectious individual.
- Some medical procedures can generate aerosols such as:
- CPAP
- BIPAP
- Nebulizer Therapy
- Manual Bag Mask Ventilation
- CPR/Code Blue
- Therefore, additional precautions (airborne) may be necessary.

### Small-Particle Aerosol
- The addition of airborne precautions, including respiratory protection (an N95 filtering face piece respirator or other appropriate particulate respirator), may be considered for a novel virus exhibiting increased transmissibility, during initial stages of an outbreak and as determined by other factors such as vaccination/immune status of staff and availability of antivirals.
- As the epidemiologic characteristics of the pandemic virus are more clearly defined, WHO and PHAC will provide updated infection control guidance, as needed.

## Summary of Infection Control Protection During a Pandemic Influenza

| COMPONENT            | RECOMMENDATIONS                                                                                     |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ARI Screening         | As per Extendicare’s policy, residents are screened daily for ARI symptoms. During a pandemic, increased screening will be required, and sites will follow public health directives. |
| Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette | Cover the mouth/nose when sneezing/coughing; use inner aspect of elbow area or use tissues and dispose in receptacles; perform hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions; wear a mask (procedure or surgical); sit or stand as far away as possible (2 metres/6 feet) from persons who are displaying respiratory symptoms when at all possible. |

# Hand Hygiene

## The 4 Moments for Hand Hygiene:
1. BEFORE initial Patient/Client environment contact
2. BEFORE aseptic procedures
3. AFTER body fluid exposure/risk
4. AFTER Patient/Client environment contact

If hands are visibly soiled or contaminated with respiratory secretions, they should be washed with soap and water. In the absence of visible soiling of hands, approved alcohol-based hand rub products for hand disinfection are preferred over soap and water because of their superior microbicidal activity, reduced drying of the skin, and convenience.

# Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

PPE includes gloves, gown, and face protection. Ensure adequate supply of PPE at all times. Under no circumstances should service be provided if appropriate PPE is not available. Extendicare sites must always maintain a 14-day rotating supply of PPE inventory.

PPE are to be used:
- During procedures and resident-care activities when contact of clothing/exposed skin with blood/body fluids, secretions, and excretions is anticipated.
- During procedures and resident care activities likely to generate splash or spray of blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions.
- When providing care to residents that are displaying respiratory symptoms.
- For touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, and contaminated items.
- For touching mucous membranes and non-intact skin.

The type of mask/respirator to be used will be dependent upon the virulence of the pandemic disease, procedures/tasks being performed, and the active respiratory symptoms of the resident.

# Safe Work Practices

- Avoid touching eyes, nose, mouth, or exposed skin with contaminated hands (gloved or ungloved).
- Avoid touching surfaces with contaminated gloves and other PPE that are not directly related to resident care (e.g., doorknobs, keys, light switches, telephone, TV remote).

*If wearing a mask, extra precaution must be taken to not manipulate the mask on face with contaminated hands/gloves.*

# Soiled Equipment for Resident Care

Handle resident equipment in a manner that prevents the transfer of microorganisms to oneself, to others, and environmental surfaces; wear gloves if visibly contaminated; perform hand hygiene after handling equipment. All equipment must be cleaned and disinfected after each use.

# Soiled Linen and Laundry

Handle in a manner that prevents transfer of microorganisms to oneself, others, and to environmental surfaces; wear gloves (gown if necessary) when handling and transporting soiled linen and laundry; and perform hand hygiene. Avoid ‘hugging’ the linen/laundry against your body.

# Environmental Cleaning and Disinfection

Emphasize cleaning/disinfection of frequently touched surfaces (e.g., phones, keyboards, light switches, door handles, shared dishes/cutlery, shared workspaces, bathroom surfaces).

# Infection Control

## Distancing

To reduce the chances of exposure, physical distancing can occur in conjunction with the promotion of respiratory/hand hygiene etiquette. Examples of physical distancing practices include:

- Cancelling routine in-person meetings in the workplace.
- At times like report, staff will stand with at least a 2-metre distance separation.
- Use alternative methods of communication such as e-mail, teleconferencing, and web conferencing to support business continuity.

Residents should also practice physical distancing during activities and dining. Persons at high risk for complications of acute respiratory illnesses should try to avoid public gatherings (e.g., movies, religious services, public meetings) when there is a pandemic in the community. They should also avoid going to other public areas (e.g., food stores, pharmacies). Alternatives such as home delivery for grocery/pharmacy are encouraged.

## Signage at Front Doors

1. Post visual alerts/signage at the entrance to the building instructing all persons with respiratory symptoms to:
- Discourage unnecessary visits
- Contact office reception by phone for further direction/assistance
- Practice respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette
2. Post signs that promote cough and hand hygiene etiquette in common areas (e.g., elevators, reception areas, cafeterias, bathrooms, meeting rooms) where they can serve as reminders to all persons in the site.
3. Facilitate adherence to respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette.
4. Ensure the availability of materials in reception areas for staff and visitors.
5. Provide tissues and receptacles for used tissue disposal.
6. Provide conveniently located dispensers of alcohol-based hand rub.
7. Provide liquid soap and disposable towels for hand washing where sinks are located.
8. Promote the use of procedure or surgical masks and physical distancing by persons with symptoms of influenza.
9. If residents are coughing, ensure they are put on isolation; if staff are coughing, ensure that they are staying home.
10. Monitor staff illness.
11. Discuss cleaning and disinfection activities with contracted environmental services.
12. Provide disposable disinfectant wipes for staff use (particular attention to shared workspace areas).

# SUMMARY OF INFECTION CONTROL PROTECTION DURING A PANDEMIC INFLUENZA

## COMPONENT RECOMMENDATIONS
- Ensure a 2 week supply/inventory in addition to pandemic supply.

## GENERAL INFECTION PREVENTION & CONTROL PRACTICES IN HEALTH CARE SETTINGS:
- Engineering controls such as ventilation systems in accordance with CSA Standards (Special Requirements for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Systems in Health Care Facilities)
- Routine and additional transmission-based infection control precautions (droplet, contact, airborne), hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette
- Screening both staff and residents
- Spatial separation of residents with symptoms, and cohorting
- Immunization & surveillance
- Use enhanced cleaning protocols
- Education & training
- Personal Protective Equipment
- Others as determined by the Health Unit based on Case Definition of the illness

## PRECAUTIONS FOR HIGH RISK PROCEDURES:
- Certain respiratory procedures such as nebulizers or aerosol generating treatments are considered higher risk. Extra precautions will be required to ensure maximum worker protection.
- When residents are diagnosed with the pandemic virus, all elective high-risk procedures (e.g. dental care) should be postponed until the illness is resolved. Any non-elective high-risk procedure should be performed using appropriate precautions to reduce the risk of exposure.

### Environmental Cleaning
- Use the same routine ENHANCED infection control and cleaning procedures during a pandemic as done for seasonal outbreaks. See IPAC and Housekeeping/Laundry Services Manuals.
- All horizontal and frequently touched surfaces should be cleaned daily and more often when soiled.

# Cleaning and Disinfection Procedures

## Overview
- May use commercial, pre-packaged disinfectant wipes with a contact time of 1 minute that are easily accessible to all staff to allow efficient cleaning of equipment and surfaces.
- Follow the Public Health Agency of Canada protocol that includes the appropriate cleaning agents to use and the contact time < 5 minutes.
- Procedures are established for assigning responsibility and accountability for enhanced cleaning of all environmental surfaces including furniture (e.g., bed rails, overbed table, telephone) and non-critical resident care items (e.g., call bell).
- Disinfection methods will be reviewed annually.
- Resident care items will be cleaned and disinfected between each resident use, including mechanical lifts.
- Components of an effective cleaning process include:
- A sufficient quantity of detergent-disinfectant in the correct concentration applied with a clean cloth.
- A contact time that complies with manufacturer's label and workplace safety requirements.

## Handling Soiled Linen
- Routine practices are used in the handling of soiled linen:
- Do not allow soiled linen to contact any surface.
- Do not allow soiled linen to contact personal clothing/uniforms.
- Handle soiled linen with gloves.
- Wash hands after handling soiled linens.

- Routine practices are applied to handling clinical waste. Double bagging of waste is NOT required.
- Disposable dishes and cutlery may be required.

## Cleaning Resident Care Equipment
- Remind staff, students, and volunteers of the guidelines for cleaning and disinfecting resident care equipment.
- Disposable equipment should be used whenever proper cleaning of the equipment can no longer be done.

# Signage for Hand Hygiene

Signage instructing all staff, visitors, and volunteers on when and how to practice hand hygiene.

## Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

Ensure that staff have quick, easy access to PPE required for droplet and contact precautions:
- Hand sanitizer
- Masks (surgical and N95)
- Eye protection
- Gloves
- Gowns

## Hand Hygiene

This is considered the most important measure in preventing the spread of all infections. Staff, volunteers, and residents shall be instructed in proper hand hygiene.

**Important Note:** Do not use resident sinks for hand hygiene unless there is no other alternative.

### Staff and Volunteers Should Perform Hand Hygiene:
- Before direct contact with a resident
- After any direct contact with a resident and before touching the face
- During the doffing process and disposing of PPE - including gloves
- Before performing invasive procedures
- Between certain procedures on the same resident where soiling of hands is likely, to avoid cross-contamination of body sites
- After contact with blood, body fluids, secretions, and excretions
- After contact with items known or likely to be contaminated with blood, body fluids, secretions, and excretions, including respiratory secretions (e.g., oxygen tubing, used tissues, masks, items handled by residents)
- Before preparing, handling, serving, or eating food and before feeding a resident

### Hand Hygiene Guidelines:
- Waterless alcohol-based hand sanitizer is as effective as hand washing if hands are not visibly soiled.
- If hands are visibly soiled, they must be washed with soap and running water.
- If soap and running water are not available, cleanse hands first with detergent-containing towelettes to remove visible soil and then use alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
- Resident/client sinks should NOT be used by staff and volunteers for hand hygiene unless no other alternative is available: sinks in both tub & shower rooms can be designated as staff washing stations. Take care to avoid contamination and use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer after hand washing.

### Residents
- Hands should be cleaned frequently but especially after using the bathroom and before and after eating.

### Criteria for Selecting Alcohol-based Hand Sanitizer:
- 70% to 90% alcohol (isopropanol or ethanol)

# PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT

## Masks
The term "mask" refers to a surgical or procedure mask, unless stated otherwise by Public Health Authorities.

- Staff and volunteers should wear masks covering the nose and mouth when providing direct care within two meters of a resident with respiratory symptoms.
- Whenever a resident with respiratory symptoms is not in his/her room, the resident will wear a surgical mask, if tolerated.
- Masks should be changed if they become wet, or contaminated by secretions.
- Staff wearing masks must remove their mask before caring for another resident, and when leaving the resident's dedicated space/room.
- Masks should be handled only by the strings/ties, to prevent self-contamination.
- If Universal masking is ordered by public health authorities, staff will follow these directives (see policy IC-05-01-13).

### Criteria for Selecting Masks:
- Securely covers the nose and mouth.
- Substantial enough to prevent droplet penetration.
- Use N95 masks and goggle-type eye protection:
- when identified as necessary by Public Health,
- when suspected TB,
- during any high-risk activity that may result in the formation of an aerosol/mist.

## Eye Protection
Eye protection includes the use of safety glasses, goggles, and face shields. It does not include personal eyeglasses.

- Eye protection will be worn when providing direct care and within two metres of a resident with respiratory symptoms.
- Safety glasses, goggles, and face shields should be removed carefully to prevent self-contamination.
- If re-used, eye protection will be cleaned in a manner that will not lead to contamination, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and Extendicare’s policies.
- To prevent self-contamination, health care workers must not touch their eyes during care of a resident with an acute respiratory illness.

### Criteria for Selecting Eye Protection:
- Eye protection must provide a barrier to splashes from the side.
- May be safety glasses, goggles or face shields.
- May be single use disposable or washable before re-use.
- Prescription eyeglasses are not acceptable as eye protection.

## Gloves
Staff & volunteers should wear gloves when they are likely to have contact with body fluids or touch contaminated surfaces.

# PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT

## Gloves
- Gloves are an additional protective measure and are not a substitute for proper hand hygiene.
- Gloves should be put on before entering and removed prior to leaving the resident's room or dedicated bed space.
- Gloves should fit the wearer to prevent cross-contamination through contact.
- Gloves should be changed between procedures on the same resident.
- Hands must be washed immediately after removing gloves.
- When a gown is worn, the cuff of the gloves must cover the cuffs of the gown.
- Single-use gloves should not be reused or washed.
- Gloves should be changed whenever a tear or leak is suspected.

## Gowns
- Long-sleeved gowns must be worn during procedures and resident care where clothing might be contaminated.
- Gowns should be removed before leaving the resident’s room or dedicated space.
- Follow the recommended Process for Removing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).

## After the health care provider has completed resident care and is more than a two-metre distance from the resident:
1. Remove gloves and discard using a glove-to-glove/skin-to-skin technique.
2. Remove gown – discard in linen hamper in a manner that minimizes air disturbance.
3. Perform hand hygiene.
4. Remove eye protection and discard or place in clear plastic bag and keep for decontamination, as appropriate.
5. Remove mask by ear loops or ties and discard.
6. Perform hand hygiene.

> This is the minimum procedure. If staff believe their hands have become contaminated during any stage of PPE removal, they should perform hand hygiene before proceeding further.

## Procuring, Storing and Distribution of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
- Building and maintaining a rotating 14-day emergency PPE inventory/stockpile is to protect our services against supply interruptions caused by emergency/pandemic situations.
- A provincial contract for PPE vendor supply is maintained through the SGP Purchasing Partner Network Team. It is expected that all sites purchase all PPE supplies through the contractual vendor unless otherwise approved.
- All items maintained in inventory will be rotated on a first-in, first-out basis to prevent stock from deterioration, contribute to employee/resident safety, and to fully utilize the merchandise purchased.

# PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT

- All case goods should have the date of receipt stamped on the outside of the box upon arrival.
- A dedicated staff member will check dated items in the inventory to ensure that the oldest items are issued first.
- Dated items must be checked on packages/supplies during the rotation procedure.
- Assign a dedicated space for your supplies (clean, dry, temperature controlled).
- Inventory record management must be monitored and concise to ensure stock supply is maintained.
- Categorize inventory by type of product/PPE.
- Purchase new PPE inventory to replace those items you have used in order to maintain a 14-day supply. When you purchase new supply, check the expiration dates with associated products.
- Move existing supplies forward and place the newly purchased stock items in the back.
- Any supply/stock items discovered that have reached expiration are to be pulled from the inventory.
- All sites are to maintain a 14-day stockpile inventory of all PPE supplies.
- Extendicare has a stockpile that can be distributed in the event of a pandemic.

## General Infection Prevention and Control

Reduce your risk of contracting a communicable disease by:

- having the annual influenza immunization
- washing your hands often - particularly after coughing or sneezing
- keeping a two-meter distance from someone who is coughing or sneezing
- avoiding activities where large numbers of people gather in enclosed spaces
- thoroughly cleaning surfaces in the home when someone is ill
- complying with any public health recommended measures
- staying home from work when ill
- covering your mouth when coughing using a tissue or sleeve rather than your hands
