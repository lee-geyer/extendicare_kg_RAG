- **External**

- **Manitoba Specific:**
- Residents must be at least 18 years of age or older to consume alcohol.

- The physician/nurse practitioner will assess the resident’s health condition, and where alcohol consumption is deemed unsafe due to medical conditions or contraindications, an order may be issued to prohibit alcohol consumption.

- Where resident history of alcohol abuse is identified, or other contraindications, the physician/nurse practitioner may provide an individualized order outlining the type of alcohol, quantity limit, and frequency of consumption (e.g., one glass of wine per day).

- The resident will be responsible for supplying his/her own alcohol where a physician/nurse practitioner's order has been obtained. The alcohol will be labeled with the resident’s name and stored in the locked medication room. Alcohol stored in resident rooms is prohibited.

- Informed consent will be obtained from the resident, Substitute Decision Maker (SDM), or Power of Attorney (POA) for alcohol consumption and documented in the resident’s health record.
