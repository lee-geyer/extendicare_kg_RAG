# PROCEDURE

## SECTION: Personal Clothing and Linen Processes - Laundry
### DESCRIPTION: Processing Isolation Linen
### INDEX: EVS3-P10.20

### Hygiene Procedures
- Clean and wipe all containers and laundry carts used for handling isolation items with disinfectant cleaner before they are put away or used again.
- Once isolation linen has been laundered, it can be dried with other clean linen. There is no need to dry separately.
- **Note:** Where possible, maximize your laundry production by washing as much isolation linen together as possible. Ensure the washer is not overloaded. Do not wash isolation linen with any other linen.
- Consider using a red bag to identify isolation linen so that it clearly stands out.
- Never sort isolation linen. The collection bag should be placed inside the washer and emptied directly.
- Never wash isolation linen with other linen.
- Isolation linen sent down the laundry chute must be double bagged, impermeable, or a nylon bag plus a garbage bag.
