## POLICY

### Resident Safety

## PROCEDURE

- Resident safety will be maintained through regular interdisciplinary staff safety rounds.
- Competent residents who decline nighttime checks must provide informed consent, which will be documented.
- Safety rounds will be conducted as part of routine care and at designated intervals.
- During these checks, staff will observe the resident, check for breathing, assess and address needs related to pain, positioning, and toileting, assist with obtaining personal items, and ensure that safety devices, such as call bells, are accessible and functional.
- Unregulated Care Providers (UCPs) are responsible for verifying the whereabouts of all residents after receiving shift reports and throughout their shift.
- If a resident is missing, the UCP must immediately notify the nurse. Any safety concerns or medical needs observed throughout the day must also be reported to the nurse.
- During evening and night shifts, once residents are asleep, UCPs will conduct hourly checks to confirm that residents remain in their rooms or designated areas.
- If a resident cannot be found, the nurse must be notified immediately.
- The frequency of safety rounds will be adjusted based on each resident’s specific risk level.
- Later in the evening or overnight, nurses will perform a building check to ensure overall safety and security.
- The Night Nurse Safety Rounds Checklist will be used to verify security measures.
- Any concerns noted from the checklist will be reported to the Director of Care (DOC) and/or Executive Director (ED) for follow-up and review.
