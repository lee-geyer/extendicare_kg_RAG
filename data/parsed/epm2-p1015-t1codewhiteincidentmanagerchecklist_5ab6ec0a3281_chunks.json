Give the person space. If there are multiple staff members at the scene, have one staff member attempt to de-escalate the situation while the other staff member stands behind to assist in removing the speaking staff member from any direct contact as needed. It is best if only one staff member is talking and trying to de-escalate so they do not further agitate or confuse the aggressive individual. Remove objects from the area that can be used as weapons, ensure there is a clear exit route. If the aggressive individual can be calmed, a Code White does not need to be paged, and the police do not need to be called, the “All Clear” will be in effect. Review Tool 2, De-escalation Techniques, for assistance on how to de-escalate an aggressive situation. - [ ] Never physically confront the agitated or aggressive individual, use action-oriented verbal communication and non-violent interventions to de-escalate the situation safely.",
