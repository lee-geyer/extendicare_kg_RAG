## MEDICAL ASSISTANCE IN DYING: FAQ FOR RESIDENTS AND FAMILIES

As a result of a Supreme Court of Canada ruling, medical assistance in dying is now legal in Canada. The Criminal Code was amended on June 6th, 2016, under federal Bill C-14 and as such, it is no longer a criminal offence in Canada for select health practitioners (doctors or nurse practitioners) to help someone end their life in certain circumstances. Further amendments to the Criminal Code were brought into force on March 17, 2021.

### 1. What is “Medical Assistance in Dying”?¹

Medical Assistance in Dying means:
- a) Administering by a doctor or nurse practitioner of a substance to a person, at their request, that causes their death; or
- b) Prescribing or providing by a doctor or nurse practitioner of a substance to a person, at their request, so that they may self-administer the substance and in doing so cause their own death.

**Note:** Until further notice, there may be limitations on the prescription or provision of oral medications used for MAID; this means that MAID will most likely be administered by a doctor or nurse practitioner via IV medication.

A request to withdraw life-sustaining treatment is not considered medical assistance in dying.

### 2. Who can provide Medical Assistance in Dying?

Any physician or nurse practitioner can legally provide medical assistance in dying. These health professionals do not have to provide assistance if he or she has a conscientious objection to medical assistance in dying for religious, ethical or other reasons. Other members of the interdisciplinary team may also express a conscientious objection. In either case, the team member has the duty to discuss your request with the Director of Care and the home has the duty to refer to a physician/nurse practitioner and care team that can consider your request provided it meets the criteria below.

The home will use the referral service in place in its jurisdiction if the medical assistance in dying is unable to be provided by physicians or care team members in the home.

### 3. Who is eligible for Medical Assistance in Dying?

A person qualifies for medical assistance in dying if they meet all the following criteria:
- a) Is eligible for a health card
- b) Is at least 18 years of age and capable of making decisions with respect to their health
- c) Has a grievous and irremediable medical condition (see question 7)
- d) Has made a voluntary request for medical assistance in dying that was not made as a result of external pressure, and
- e) Gives informed consent to receive medical assistance in dying.²

# Frequently Asked Question: MAID

## 4. What does competent mean?
A competent person has decision-making capacity. This means you are able to:
- Understand the information that is relevant to making a decision about the treatment, and
- Appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences of a decision or lack of decision.³

Your capacity will be determined by two independent healthcare providers who are either physicians or nurse practitioners.

## 5. What does it mean to clearly consent?
You will need to make two separate requests for medical assistance in dying. At least one request should be in writing. This shows you are sure about your request. Your team wants to be certain that you are not being forced into this decision, and that you have all the information you need to make this decision.

## 6. Is there a waiting period?
No. The requirement for a minimum 10-day reflection period is now removed as of March 17, 2021 amendments to the law for those whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable.

For those whose natural death is not reasonably foreseeable, eligibility assessments must take at least 90 days, but this period can be shortened if the person is about to lose their capacity to make health care decisions, as long as both assessments have been completed.

## 7. What does grievous and irremediable medical condition mean?
A person has a grievous and irremediable medical condition if:
a) they have a serious and incurable illness, disease, or disability;
b) they are in an advanced state of irreversible decline in capability;
c) that illness, disease, or disability or that state of decline causes them enduring physical or psychological suffering that is intolerable to them and that cannot be relieved under conditions that they consider acceptable.

## 8. What is enduring suffering?
Enduring suffering is physical or psychological pain or distress that you have lived with for a long time.

## 9. What is intolerable suffering?
Intolerable suffering is physical or psychological pain or distress that you find unbearable.

# Frequently Asked Questions: MAID

## 10. How is medical assistance in dying different from stopping or not starting treatment?
Residents may choose to stop treatment or not to start treatment. These decisions, like assisted dying, are each resident’s decisions to make. Residents base these decisions on their values, beliefs, and healthcare goals. The key difference is the intent of the decision. Residents who choose to stop treatment or not to start treatment intend to avoid treatment that will not provide a benefit or that is too difficult. Their intent is not necessarily to bring about their own death. If death happens, the cause of death will be their disease. With medical assistance in dying, the resident’s death is intended.

## 11. Is medical assistance in dying the same as assisted suicide?
They are similar. Medical assistance in dying includes both patient-administered and physician-administered methods. In the past, the patient-administered method was called assisted suicide.

## 12. Do I have to undergo treatment first?
No, you do not have to undergo treatment (e.g., chemotherapy, surgery) you find unacceptable. The Supreme Court wrote that irremediable: “… does not require the patient to undertake treatments that are not acceptable to the individual.”⁴

## 13. Is there a right decision?
This is a personal decision based on your values, beliefs, and health care goals. You determine what is right or wrong for you.

## 14. Does my physician have to agree I meet the criteria?
You will be assessed by two (2) or more physicians or nurse practitioners. They will have to agree that you meet the criteria. If one or more feels you do not meet the criteria, you can ask to be assessed by another physician or nurse practitioner.

## 15. Can I expect my health care team to provide medical assistance in dying?
Maybe. Many healthcare professionals and some healthcare institutions will be unwilling to help with assisted dying because it is not comfortable for them or goes against an institution’s faith-based mission. It is a very personal choice for them, too. If they cannot help, you will be connected to a person or resource that will.

## 16. Do I have to inform my family?
It is usually a good idea to try to involve your family – getting medical assistance in dying may have a major impact on them. If it is difficult to talk with your family for any reason, you can ask for help from your healthcare team (e.g., social workers, spiritual care providers, occupational therapists, or others).

## 17. How long will the assessment take?
It depends how much time the physicians or nurse practitioners require to make sure that you meet the criteria. Please speak to your healthcare team if you have concerns.

## 18. Where can I have Medical Assistance in Dying?
Assistance in dying can be provided in hospitals, in the community, and in the home. Your healthcare team will help you to review the options and discuss what is best for you.

# Frequently Asked Questions: MAID

## 19. Can family provide assistance in dying?
No. But family can help you to complete forms and provide support to the physician or nurse practitioner during the process, and provide you support throughout the process.

## 20. Can I have family and friends with me when I die?
Yes, you can have people of importance to you during assisted dying. You should discuss this with them well in advance to make sure they are willing to be present. The health care team will help prepare you and them. They need to understand what happens during medical assistance in dying before they agree.

## 21. Can others make the decision for me?
No, only you can make the decision to request assistance in dying. If you are not capable, others cannot make the decision for you.

## 22. Can I write down my wishes in case I lose capacity?
No, you must be able to ask for assisted dying at the time. You cannot write your wishes for assistance in dying in an advance care plan.

## 23. Can I change my mind?
Yes, you can change your mind at any time, for any reason. Simply tell a member of your health care team. If you change your mind, there will be no negative consequences; you will continue to receive high quality care. No one will think any less of you if you change your mind.

## 24. What happens if the patient can’t sign?
If the patient requesting assistance in dying is not able to sign and date the request, another person (at least 18 years of age) who understands that the patient is requesting medical assistance in dying may do so in the patient’s presence on their behalf. Individuals may not sign on behalf of the resident if they know or believe that they are a beneficiary under the will of the resident making the request, or a recipient, in any other way, of a financial or other material benefit resulting from that person’s death. Staff members are not eligible to sign a MAID request on a resident’s behalf.

## 25. What if I have other questions?
If you have other questions, please ask a member of your health care team. Additional information can be obtained from the provincial health regulatory Colleges governing physicians and nurse practitioners.
