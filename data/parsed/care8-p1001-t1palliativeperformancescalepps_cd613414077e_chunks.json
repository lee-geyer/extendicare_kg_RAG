PPS may be used for several purposes:\n- First, it is an excellent communication tool for quickly describing a patient’s current functional level. - Second, it may have value in criteria for workload assessment or other measurements and comparisons. - Finally, it appears to have prognostic value.### 2. Definition of Terms for PPS\nAs noted below, some of the terms have similar meanings with the differences being more readily apparent as one reads horizontally across each row to find an overall ‘best fit’ using all five columns.#### 2.1 Ambulation\n- The items ‘mainly sit/lie,’ ‘mainly in bed,’ and ‘totally bed bound’ are clearly similar. The subtle differences are related to items in the self-care column. For example, ‘totally bed bound’ at PPS 30% is due to either profound weakness or paralysis such that the patient not only can’t get out of bed but is also unable to do any self-care. The difference between ‘sit/lie’ and ‘bed’ is proportionate to the amount of time the patient is able to sit up vs need to lie down. - ‘Reduced ambulation’ is located at the PPS 70% and PPS 60% level.",

By using the adjacent column, the reduction of ambulation is tied to inability to carry out their normal job, work occupation or some hobbies or housework activities. The person is still able to walk and transfer on their own but at PPS 60% needs occasional assistance.#### 2.2 Activity & Extent of Disease\n- ‘Some,’ ‘significant,’ and ‘extensive’ disease refer to physical and investigative evidence which shows degrees of progression. For example, in breast cancer:\n- A local recurrence would imply ‘some’ disease. - One or two metastases in the lung or bone would imply ‘significant’ disease. - Multiple metastases in lung, bone, liver, brain, hypercalcemia or other major complications would be ‘extensive’ disease. - The extent may also refer to progression of disease despite active treatments. Using PPS in AIDS:\n- ‘Some’ may mean the shift from HIV to AIDS. - ‘Significant’ implies progression in physical decline, new or difficult symptoms and laboratory findings with low counts.",

Decline in activity may mean the person still plays golf but reduces from playing 18 holes to 9 holes, or just a par 3, or to backyard putting. People who enjoy walking will gradually reduce the distance covered, although they may continue trying, sometimes even close to death (e.g., trying to walk the halls).----© Copyright Notice.

Self-Care\n- **Occasional assistance** means that most of the time patients are able to transfer out of bed, walk, wash, toilet, and eat by their own means, but that on occasion (perhaps once daily or a few times weekly) they require minor assistance. - **Considerable assistance** means that regularly every day the patient needs help, usually by one person, to do some of the activities noted above. For example, the person needs help to get to the bathroom but is then able to brush his or her teeth or wash at least hands and face. Food will often need to be cut into edible sizes but the patient is then able to eat of his or her own accord. - **Mainly assistance** is a further extension of ‘considerable.’ Using the above example, the patient now needs help getting up but also needs assistance washing his face and shaving, but can usually eat with minimal or no help. This may fluctuate according to fatigue during the day. - **Total care** means that the patient is completely unable to eat without help, toilet, or do any self-care.",

Conscious Level\n- **‘Full consciousness’** implies full alertness and orientation with good cognitive abilities in various domains of thinking, memory, etc. - **‘Confusion’** is used to denote presence of either delirium or dementia and is a reduced level of consciousness. It may be mild, moderate, or severe with multiple possible etiologies. - **‘Drowsiness’** implies either fatigue, drug side effects, delirium, or closeness to death and is sometimes included in the term stupor.",
