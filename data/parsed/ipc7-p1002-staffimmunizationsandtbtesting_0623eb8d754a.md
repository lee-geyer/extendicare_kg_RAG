## POLICY

### Immunization of Residents and Staff

## PROCEDURE

1. Staff submit a completed Staff Immunization/TB Testing Record as a component of the hiring process for new employees that includes results for:
a. Current immunizations including seasonal influenza; and
b. TB record or screening tool to be reviewed for completion, as provincially required.
c. Arrange for follow-up and appropriate testing with your physician/nurse practitioner if you are a new staff member who has had previous reaction to a TB test. You must submit a note indicating your negative TB status before you can begin working at the home.
d. A copy of the Staff Immunization/TB testing record is to be kept in the staff member's health file and uploaded to Workday.

### External Guidelines

- **Manitoba** – TST testing is presently not required. Refer to Occupational Health and Safety.
- **Alberta** - A single step TST is recommended. A two-step TST is required for those who work in high-risk areas where residents with active TB are present.
- **Ontario** - A 2 step TST is recommended 1-4 weeks apart. If a single step has been done within the past year and is negative, a second step can be performed alone for those not at high risk of TB exposure.
