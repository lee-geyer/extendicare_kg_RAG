# What is a Restraint?

## Defining Restraints & PASDs

- **Physical Restraint**: Any device restricting movement that a resident cannot easily remove.
- **Chemical Restraint**: Medication used to control behaviour rather than treat a medical condition.
- **Environmental Restraint**: Restricting movement through barriers (e.g., locked doors).
- **Personal Assistance Service Device (PASD)**: Device that supports independence, may also act as a restraint if used improperly.

# When is a Restraint Appropriate?
