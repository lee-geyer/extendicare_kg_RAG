## POLICY
### Emergency Response Codes

## PROCEDURE
### Code Grey - Essential Services
Code Grey - Essential Services is announced when any of the home's essential services are not functioning (essential services include but are not limited to, telephones, computer systems, fire alarm system, mag lock systems, wanderguard systems, life safety systems, call bells, elevators, HVAC systems, power, etc.).

### Prepare
The Executive Director/Designate will:
- Be familiar with the procedures for disconnecting the automatic operation of doors, if applicable. Ensure instructions are included in the home’s Emergency Response Plan.
- Ensure the home is equipped with a stand-by generator or has access to one quickly, with little notice.
- Ensure the home’s Emergency Response Plan includes (printed) schematics of air exchange controls, ventilation, and/or HVAC equipment including each of their locations.
- Keep flashlights at each nursing station to assist in the event of a power failure.
- Consider purchasing inverter battery packs to allow beds to continue to be raised and lowered during a power outage.
- Ensure an adequate supply of extension cords is kept in a designated area of the home (for example a cabinet in each nursing station/Emergency Operations Centre) to have at least 2 extension cords for every 10 beds.

> **Note:** Improper extension cord use can be a potential fire hazard:
> - Avoid octopus electrical connections (multiple extension cords plugged into a single power outlet).
> - Use extension cords capable of carrying the intended load (i.e., do not use an extension cord for a window A/C unit that is meant for a desk lamp).
> - Do not plug a power bar into an extension cord (power bars should be plugged directly into the wall outlet).

- Conduct a monthly review of the eMAR backup system to ensure it is backing up the files hourly. Refer to PointClickCare eMAR Backup System SOP for instructions on file backup.
- Ensure laptops, tablets, and work phones are charged.
- Be aware of which printer is connected to the stand-by generator.
