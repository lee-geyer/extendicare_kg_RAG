Non-washable items are to be given to the family to be cleaned unless other arrangements have been made.- Remove laundry bags containing soiled linen after each round, or more often if needed, to support infection control and reduce odours. Pull the bag closed using the drawstring and closure. - Remove gross soil such as faeces and dispose into toilet or hopper. Do not remove excrement by spraying with water. Transport soiled items to the soiled utility room and rinse as required. During transport, fold the linen inwards to contain heavy soil. Place rinsed item in appropriate hamper.",

Make sure you wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and thoroughly clean your hands after handling soiled linen.#### External\n- In some provinces (such as Manitoba), public health directives permit only the dumping of solid waste. In these provinces, do not rinse soiled linen on the home area. Deposit heavily soiled linen into the appropriate bags. - Deliver or send laundry to the laundry frequently during your shift. This will ensure that the Laundry Department operates continually, and the risk of odours is reduced. - Notify the Manager or designate if there is a shortage of bags for collection of linens or if bags are being received in the home areas without drawstrings.## EDUCATION",
