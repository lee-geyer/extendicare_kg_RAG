## Final Clean Checklist – Sporicidal Disinfectant

| Room No. & Unit: | Date: | Enter date |
|-------------------|-------|------------|
| Housekeeper AM:   |       |            |
| Housekeeper PM:   |       |            |
| Manager/designate:|       |            |

When C. difficile is no longer present in an isolation room, the room will be double cleaned. Double cleaning is repeating a cleaning regimen immediately after it has been done once.

### Notes:
1. Use a separate cloth to clean each room area:
- bed and furniture
- walls and doors
- washroom walls and doors
- washroom counter and sink
- toilet, commode and raised toilet seats.
2. A sporicidal disinfectant is applied to all “high touch” surfaces in the room. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for contact time: product must be rinsed off after 10 minutes.
3. A sporicidal toilet bowl cleaner is used for washroom cleaning. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for contact time: product must be rinsed off after 10 minutes.
4. Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide .5% will be used on all other items. If unsure of which product to use where, see Manager for direction.
