## Abbreviations
- **AGMP** – Aerosol-Generating Medical Procedure
- **CDC** – Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
- **HCW** – Health Care Worker
- **PCRA** – Point of Care Risk Assessment
- **PPE** – Personal Protective Equipment

## Definitions
- **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**: Equipment a person wears to protect themselves from risks to their health or safety, including exposure to infectious agents. The level of PPE required depends on the:
- suspected or known infectious agent
- severity of the illness caused
- transmission route of the infectious agent
- procedure or task being undertaken

- **Risk Assessment**: An ongoing process that begins with the admission assessment and ends only when the resident is discharged.

- **Routine Practices**: Practices that prevent and control the spread of infection and are used with all residents during all care situations.

- **Universal Masking**: In long-term care, universal masking is defined as the requirement for all persons (staff, residents, visitors, service providers, and others) to wear a mask at all times except for when eating or drinking.

- **Health Care Workers**: Health care workers include all people primarily engaged in actions with the primary intent of enhancing health. Examples are: nursing, health care aides, personal support workers, doctors, cleaners, and other staff who work in the long-term care home.

# Types of Personal Protective Equipment

PPE must be:

- provided by the home for staff use. Staff must not bring their own PPE to the workplace. Any issue with PPE comfort or fit should be discussed with their supervisor, JHSC member and/or brought to the attention of Extendicare’s corporate health and safety team.
- located at the entrance of any resident room where a resident requires additional precautions.
- stored safely and in a clean, dry area to prevent contamination.
- stored in a convenient and accessible area in each Resident Home Area/Unit/Household or floor.
- stocked with a minimum two-week supply, within expiry dates.
- single use unless specified by the manufacturer.
- changed immediately after each resident and/or after completing a procedure or task.
- disposed into the isolation garbage provided in each room.
- discarded if damaged or contaminated.
- safely doffed (removed) to avoid self-contamination.

Although the use of PPE controls is the most visible in the hierarchy of controls, it is the last tier in the hierarchy and should not be relied on as a stand-alone primary prevention program. The PPE tier refers to the availability, support and appropriate use of physical barriers between the HCWs and an infectious agent/infected source to minimize exposure and prevent transmission. Examples of PPE barriers include gloves, gowns, facial protection (including surgical masks and N95 respirators), and eye protection (safety glasses, face shields or masks with visor attachments). The long-term care home plays a critical role in ensuring HCWs have access to appropriate PPE for the task to be performed and the necessary education and training to ensure competency on the appropriate selection, use and disposal of PPE to prevent exposure to infection¹.

## Headwear

Headwear worn for religious reasons (for example, turban, kippot, veil, headscarves) are permitted provided resident safety is not compromised. Headwear is NOT considered PPE; however, they must be washed and/or changed between each shift or immediately if contaminated.
```

```markdown
# Gloves Policy

## Purpose
Gloves should be worn when there may be exposure to blood, bodily fluids, secretions, or excretions and when handling contaminated equipment.

## Guidelines for Use
- Gloves should be put on immediately before the commencement of a task and removed as soon as the task has been completed.
- Gloves must never be decontaminated and reused. They are a single-use item and should only be worn once and then discarded.
- Gloves should be disposed of into the appropriate waste receptacle immediately after use.
- If gloves cause irritation, healthcare workers should consult the Occupational Health Service or seek medical advice.

**Note:** Gloves do not replace the requirement for good hand hygiene.

## Risks of Inappropriate Use
Gloves can sometimes be used inappropriately, and failure to remove them at the correct time and complete hand hygiene effectively can increase the risk of transmitting infections to vulnerable residents. Each healthcare worker should understand the rationale for glove use and assess the potential risk that each task carries.

## Appropriate Glove Use
- **NEVER** wash/sanitize or re-use gloves.
- Select gloves appropriate to the task.
- Wear the correct size of gloves.
- Perform hand hygiene before putting on gloves.
- Gloves should be put on immediately before the activity for which they are indicated.
- Gloves must be removed and discarded immediately after the activity for which they were used.
- Hand hygiene must be performed immediately after glove removal.
- Change or remove gloves if moving from a contaminated body site to a clean body site for the same resident.
- Change or remove gloves after touching a contaminated site and before touching a clean site or the environment.

**Important:** Double-gloving is NOT permitted.
```

# Gowns

- Wear a gown to protect uniform, bare skin, or clothes when contamination is anticipated or likely.
- Wear a gown when providing direct care within 2 (two) metres of a suspected/confirmed respiratory illness.
- Change gowns between residents and immediately after completing a procedure or task.
- Wear a gown when conducting AGMPs.

> **Note:** Disposable gowns are designed to protect the worker during direct resident care.

## Appropriate Gown Use

- Gowns should be worn based on point-of-care risk assessment and as required for additional precautions.
- When the use of a gown is indicated, the gown should be put on immediately before the task and must be worn properly, i.e., tied at the top and around the waist.
- Remove the gown immediately after the task for which it has been used in a manner that prevents contamination of clothing or skin and prevents agitation of the gown.
- Discard used gown immediately after removal into the appropriate receptacle. Do not hang gowns for later use.
- Do not re-use gowns. Do not go from resident to resident wearing the same gown.
- Hands should always be washed/sanitized after removal of a gown.

# Eye/Face Protection

## Appropriate Protective Eye/Face Equipment

Protective eye/face equipment should:

- Cover the entire face area if protection of the mouth and nose area is also required (e.g., face shield);
- Be changed if visibly soiled or when exiting an isolation room;
- Be removed using the earpieces/headband to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces; and
- Fit over prescription glasses.

A face shield does not negate the need for a mask; a mask is to be worn under the face shield.

Eye and face protection must be worn when there is risk of splashing body fluids onto mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth. Eyes can be protected by wearing either goggles or a visor. Prescription glasses are not a suitable substitute. If reusable eye/face protection is used, it should be disinfected in accordance with the manufacturer’s guidelines. Hands should always be sanitized after removing the equipment.

## Appropriate Eye/Face Protection Use

Eye or face protection (including full-face visors) must:

- Not be impeded by accessories such as piercings or false eyelashes; and
- Not be touched when being worn.

Eye protection should be used whenever there is a potential for splashes or sprays to the eyes, such as cleaning and disinfecting personal care equipment, wound irrigation, or AGMPs.

- Eye protection must be removed immediately after the task for which it was used and discarded into waste.
- Make sure that the eye protection being worn properly fits and does not interfere with the proper fit of the health care worker’s mask.
- Discard reusable eye protection if damaged or difficult to see through.

Prescription eyeglasses are NOT accepted as a form of eye protection as they may not fully protect the eye area and do not provide coverage from the side. If prescription eyeglasses are worn, another type of protection must be worn over the eyeglasses.
```

# Eye/Face Protection Considerations

## Types of Approved Protection

| Protection Type | Considerations |
|------------------|----------------|
| **Goggles**      | - Goggles provide the most reliable eye protection from splashes, sprays, and respiratory droplets with the snug fit around the eyes.
- Goggles can be re-used by the SAME user if they are cleaned/disinfected after each use or until they become damaged/cracked or visibility is compromised.
- The characteristics of goggles that make them the most reliable protection for the wearer may also cause discomfort when wearing them for extended periods of time. |
| **Face Shield**  | - The face shield must cover the front and sides of the face to reduce the possibility of splash, spray, or respiratory droplets from going around the edges of the shield.
- A face shield can be re-used by the same USER if it is cleaned/disinfected after each use or until it becomes damaged/cracked or visibility is compromised.
- HCWs should label their face shield and store it in a breathable container or paper bag after it is properly cleaned and disinfected between uses. |
| **Safety Glasses** | - Safety glasses may be used but they do not provide the same level of protection from splashes, sprays and/or respiratory droplets as goggles or face shields.
- Safety glasses can be re-used by the same USER if they are cleaned/disinfected after each use or until they become damaged/cracked or visibility is compromised.
- If a HCW chooses to wear them, make sure that they fit snugly with no gaps between the glasses and the face. |

# Masks and Respirators

Masks/respirators should:

- be worn properly to securely cover the nose and mouth;
- be changed if damaged, soiled or wet;
- not be removed to speak;
- not be shared with others;
- be removed correctly and immediately after completion of the task;
- be discarded before leaving an isolation room; and
- not be folded or put in a pocket for later use.

**NIOSH**: 3 18605
**HALMH**: N95 LOLZonj
**ICUA**: Aᴼᵖ⁸²
**Je7705**

Masks filter droplets as small as 3 micrometre, whereas respirators (N95) may filter 0.075 micrometre solid particles when properly fitted.

For any type of mask/respirator, appropriate use, storage and cleaning, or disposal are essential to ensure that they are as effective as possible and to avoid any increased risk of transmission. It is essential to adhere to correct mask and respirator management practices. The use of masks is part of a comprehensive component of prevention and control measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including COVID-19. Masks can be used for protection of healthy persons (worn to protect oneself when in contact with an infected individual) or for source control (worn by an infected individual to prevent onward transmission), or both.

## Appropriate Mask/Respirator Use

- Perform hand hygiene before putting on the mask.
- Inspect the mask for tears or holes, and do not use if damaged.
- Place the mask carefully, ensuring it covers the mouth and nose, adjust to the nose bridge to minimize any gaps between the face and the mask. If using ear loops, ensure these do not cross over as this widens the gap between the face and the mask.
- Avoid touching the mask while wearing it. If the mask is accidentally touched, perform hand hygiene.
- Remove the mask using the appropriate technique. Do not touch the front of the mask.
- Replace the mask as soon as it becomes dirty or damp or wet with a new clean, dry mask.
- Do not place the mask around the arm or wrist or pull it down to rest around the chin or neck.
- Perform hand hygiene immediately after discarding the mask.
- Do not re-use single-use masks.
- Discard single-use masks after each use and properly dispose of them immediately upon removal.
- Refer to the N95 respirator section of this guide for additional information on N95 respirators’ use.
```

# N95 Respirators

## Negative Pressure Check
Place both hands completely over the respirator and inhale sharply. Be careful not to disturb the position of the respirator. The respirator should pull into your face. If air leaks around it, adjust the nosepiece and straps and repeat.

## Positive Pressure Check
Put your hands over the respirator and breathe out sharply. If your respirator has an exhalation valve, be sure to cover the exhalation valve when you exhale. No air should leak out of the respirator if it fits properly. If air leaks out, re-adjust the nosepiece and straps and repeat².

### Usage Guidelines
- **N95 respirators** should be worn by health care providers when performing aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMP) on residents with a respiratory infection.
- Although a resident with undiagnosed or suspected tuberculosis, measles, chicken pox, or disseminated shingles would be sent to the hospital, it is important to note an N95 respirator is required.
- Fit-tested every 2 years or more frequently if significant changes such as weight loss/gain or oral surgery occur.
- Ensure facial hair does not interfere with the seal.
- The **ICP** is responsible for ensuring that the respirator fit-testing program is in place and that staff are dedicated to respirator fit testing as per policy upon hire and every 2 years thereafter.

## How to Wear the N95 Respirator
Always read and follow the manufacturer’s directions when using an N95 respirator. It must cover both the nose and mouth to keep you from breathing aerosols. If it does not have a snug fit, it will not work properly. Correct fit of the respirator requires contact with smooth skin. It will not work properly for people with beards or facial hair. Even one-day beard growth has been shown to let air leak in. Always use both straps on the respirator to hold it in place to keep air from leaking around it.

## How to Make Sure the Respirator Fits
Do a user seal check, including both positive and negative pressure checks, to verify that you have correctly put on the respirator and adjusted it to fit properly.

### Six Steps to Wearing the N95 Respirator
1. Wash your hands thoroughly before putting on the respirator.
2. Use an N95 respirator that has been fit-tested for you: hold the respirator and place it firmly over your nose, mouth, and chin.
3. First, stretch and position the bottom band under your ears. Then, stretch and position the top band high at the back of your head.
4. Press the thin metal wire along the upper edge gently against the bridge of your nose so that the respirator fits snugly on your face.
5. Perform a fit check by breathing in and out. While breathing out, check for air leakage around your face.

### Six Steps to Removing the N95 Respirator
1. Perform hand hygiene.
2. Grasp the bottom band of the respirator and gently pull over the top of the head.
3. Grasp the top band of the respirator and gently pull over the top of the head.
4. Lean slightly forward and remove the respirator from the face, handling only the bands and avoiding all contact with the front of the respirator.
5. Dispose of the respirator into an appropriate waste container.
6. Perform hand hygiene.

# What is a PCRA?

A Point of Care Risk Assessment (PCRA) is not a new concept, but one that is already performed regularly by staff many times a day for their safety and the safety of residents and others in the healthcare environment. For example, when a staff member assesses a resident and situation to determine the possibility of blood or body fluid exposure or chooses appropriate PPE to care for a resident with an infectious disease, these actions are both activities of a PCRA.

A PCRA assesses the task, the resident, and the environment — it is a dynamic risk assessment completed by the HCW before every resident interaction to determine whether there is a risk of being exposed to an infection. Performing a PCRA is the first step in Routine Practices, which are to be used with all residents, for all care and assuming their behaviour does not put others at risk.

## Key Considerations

- A PCRA will help determine the correct PPE required to protect the health care worker in their interaction with the resident and resident environment.

Health care workers conduct general point of care assessments many times a day (often subconsciously). For example, when you approach a resident, you automatically note their mental status, ease of breathing, skin colour, etc.

### Questions to Ask During a PCRA

1. What contact am I going to have with the resident?
- (direct hands-on care vs. no hands-on care; contact with mucus membranes or non-intact skin)
2. What task(s) or procedure(s) am I going to perform?
- Is there a risk of splashes/sprays? Likely to stimulate a cough? Or gagging?
3. If the resident has diarrhea, is she/he continent?
- If incontinent, can stool be contained in an adult incontinence product?
4. Is the resident able and willing to perform hand hygiene?
- Or respiratory hygiene (covering their cough/sneeze)?
5. Is the resident able to follow instructions?
6. Is the resident in a shared room?
- Is there a better room/space that I should use to provide this care?
7. Is there personal protective equipment that I should put on prior to this task?

In general, residents who are on contact precautions can engage in all daily activities along with other residents and staff, without restriction, provided they are otherwise healthy and fit to participate (and which are to be used with all residents, for all care).

### Additional Guidelines

- Risk of cross-contamination should be evaluated when considering any restrictions.
- Skin lesions should be covered with appropriate dressings.
- Residents with covered skin lesions need NOT be restricted.
- Residents should perform hand hygiene prior to each meal and prior to participating in any activity or outing so that they may:
- Eat at the same table and same time as other residents, and may share the same condiments, such as salt, pepper, dressings, or garnishes, with other residents;
- Use the same dishes and cutlery (disposable eating utensils or dishes not needed);
- Participate in any social function within the home; and/or
- Travel together in the same vehicle with other residents to-and-from activities (no special vehicle preparation or cleaning is required).

Residents who are incapable of performing hand hygiene independently should be offered assistance prior to each meal and prior to participating in any activity or outing.

# Conducting a PCRA Routine Practices Point of Care Risk Assessment Algorithm (PCRA)

## Point of Care Risk Assessment (PCRA)

A Point of Care Risk Assessment (PCRA) should be conducted before every resident interaction by a trained health care worker (HCW) to assess the likelihood of exposing themselves and/or others to infectious agents.

An individual assessment of each resident’s potential risk of transmission of microorganisms must be made by all health care providers and other staff who have contact with them. Based on that risk assessment, staff will determine appropriate intervention and interaction strategies, such as:

- Hand hygiene
- Waste management
- Use of personal protective equipment (PPE)
- Resident placement

These strategies will reduce the risk of transmission of microorganisms to and from the individual. Use the PCRA Algorithm to guide PPE use for all resident interactions.

# Residents on Contact Precautions

In general, residents who are on contact precautions can engage in all daily activities along with other residents and staff, without restriction, provided they are otherwise healthy and fit to participate (and assuming their behaviour does not put others at risk).

- Risk of cross-contamination should be evaluated when considering any restrictions.
- Skin lesions should be covered with appropriate dressings.
- Residents with covered skin lesions need NOT be restricted.
- Residents should perform hand hygiene prior to each meal and prior to participating in any activity or outing so that they may:
- Eat at the same table and same time as other residents, and may share the same condiments, such as salt, pepper, dressings, or garnishes, with other residents;
- Use the same dishes and cutlery (disposable eating utensils or dishes not needed);
- Participate in any social function within the home; and/or
- Travel together in the same vehicle with other residents to-and-from activities (no special vehicle preparation or cleaning is required).

Residents who are incapable of performing hand hygiene independently should be offered assistance prior to each meal and prior to participating in any activity or outing.

# PPE and Bathing

Daily personal care will be provided to residents in a manner that promotes resident choice and preferences, promotes comfort and independence, as well as safety and health, while considering the residents’ needs, dignity, and privacy.

When gloves are required for personal care, they must be single-use disposable and be discarded after use. The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that non-sterile gloves are not required routinely for washing and dressing residents. Health care workers need to assess individual patients for risk of exposure to blood and body fluids. Evidence suggests that residents prefer health care workers to wear gloves to provide intimate care, for example, peri care.

When gloves are required for personal care, they must be single-use and be disposed of after use.

## Risk Assessment

Showering or tub bathing may create splashes and sprays of water and the possibility of exposure to body fluids/secretions from the resident with the water splash. Use a point of care risk assessment to determine if you need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE).

# Routine Practices

Everyone in the home continually uses routine practices to prevent the spread of infections. All care staff assess the level of risk related to exposure to blood, body fluids, or non-intact skin, implement and follow the required routine practices and additional precautions when providing care for residents. The home provides all required supplies and equipment needed for routine practices and additional practices.

Performing routine practices that encompass a system of infection prevention and control principles include:

## Risk Assessment
- Review care requirements prior to each contact with a resident.
- Be aware of what level of contact with blood and body secretions can be expected and based on the assessment, ensure appropriate protective precautions including hand hygiene.

## Hand Hygiene
- Practice thorough washing and/or sanitizing of hands before and after any direct resident or environment contact and when handling any soiled articles such as soiled laundry or equipment.

## Personal Protective Equipment
- Select type of PPE and usage based upon Risk Assessment. Refer to the previous sections of this PPE Guide for proper use and application of specific PPE, including gloves. It is recommended that all items be single-use disposable.

## Process/Procedure for PPE Use
- **Gloves** – Always perform proper hand hygiene before donning and after doffing gloves.
- **Gowns** – Wear a gown if there is a risk of contamination of a staff member’s skin and clothing.
- **Masks** – Wear a mask if there is a risk of the staff member’s mucous membranes, nose, and mouth being contaminated with a resident’s body fluids.
- **Eye Protection** – Wear eye protection if there is a risk of the staff member’s mucous membranes and eyes being contaminated with a resident’s body fluids.

## Administrative Controls
- Policies and procedures, staff education, respiratory etiquette, and auditing.

### Engineering Controls
- Engineering controls are physical or mechanical measures put in place to reduce the risk of infection to staff or to residents (examples: barriers, HVAC).
```

```markdown
# Additional Precautions

Additional Precautions are to be used in addition to Routine Practices when Routine Practices alone may not be sufficient for preventing transmission of an infectious agent. There are three categories of Additional Precautions based on the mode of transmission:

1. **Contact Precautions** for interrupting transmissions via the direct or indirect contact route.
2. **Droplet Precautions** for interrupting transmissions via the droplet route.
3. **Airborne Precautions** for interrupting transmissions via the airborne route.

Additional Precautions should be instituted when symptoms are identified, and before test/lab results are received. The highest level of precautions should be implemented until confirmation of the infectious agent.

For details on Additional Precautions in the long-term care setting, see PIDAC’s Routine Practices and Additional Precautions for All Health Care Settings document below.

# AGMP - Aerosol Generating Medical Procedures

Aerosol generating medical procedures (AGMPs) are any procedure carried out on a resident that can induce the production of aerosols of various sizes, including droplet nuclei, in high concentration. These droplet nuclei may contain bacteria or viruses that could present a risk for opportunistic airborne transmission of pathogens not otherwise able to spread by the airborne route (e.g., SARS) and increase the risk for transmission of organisms known to spread by the airborne route (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis).

## PPE Practices

Correct PPE use is required when performing AGMPs to reduce the likelihood of transmission to health care workers. During AGMP procedures, an N95 respirator is required when the resident:

- has signs or symptoms of suspected/presumed/confirmed COVID-19 and meets exposure criteria consistent with COVID-19;
- has a nasopharyngeal swab that has been ordered or the results of swab are in progress;
- is in a home and/or home area that the Provincial Medical Officer of Health has designated all residents as potential COVID-19 contacts; and/or
- exhibits any respiratory symptoms.

### AGMP in Progress (Poster)

#### N95 Respirator Required in Addition to PPE for Contact and Droplet Precautions

- Wear long-sleeved gown
- Wear eye protection
- Wear N95 or equivalent, fit tested and seal-checked respirator
- Maintain 2 metres of distance from resident
- Wear N95 gloves

### AGMP PPE Doffing Sequence*

In room:
1. Remove gloves
2. Perform hand hygiene
3. Remove gown
4. Perform hand hygiene

After exiting the room:
5. Remove goggles
6. Perform hand hygiene
7. Remove respirator (use the six-step removal process located in the N95 Respirators section of this Guide)
8. Perform hand hygiene

*Note: For correct doffing techniques, refer to Doffing PPE section of this Guide.

- An AGMP Precautionary poster placed outside of a resident’s room doorway will identify the PPE required by those entering the room.
- Duration of these PPE precautions will be identified on the reverse side of the poster once the procedure has completed.

> A face shield should not be used. Goggles are required when performing an AGMP and may also be required up to three hours following the completion of an AGMP.

# Donning PPE

## Step 1
(Without universal PPE strategy)
Always include your wrists in your hand hygiene process.

## Step 2
Do not pull the disposable gown too tight, as this may result in the protective seal being broken at the wrist area or the gown ripping as there is not enough flexibility when leaning forward.

## Step 3
Secure the ties or elastic around your head so the mask stays in place securely. Fit the moldable band to the nose bridge to fit snugly to your face and below the chin.

## Step 4
Adjust to fit tightly leaving no gap.

## Step 5
Always pull gloves over cuff of gown.

- PPE must be donned correctly before entering the resident area (e.g., isolation room, unit if cohorting).
- PPE must remain in place and be worn correctly for the duration of work in potentially contaminated areas. PPE should not be adjusted (e.g., retying gown, adjusting respirator/mask) during resident care.

----

**PAGE 19**

# Doffing PPE

## Step 1
Follow the proper glove-to-glove, skin-to-skin technique to avoid common contamination when removing gloves.

### (Without universal PPE strategy)

## Step 2
If Universal PPE Strategy is in place, doff all PPE before leaving an isolation room; a new mask and new/disinfected eye protection is required after exiting.

## Step 3
When pulling the gown off, do not touch the outside areas. Roll the gown inside out and place in the garbage.

## Step 4
Use the proper hand hygiene technique for 15 seconds.

## Step 5
Handle only by headband or earpieces and carefully pull away from the face. Place reusable items in a container for cleaning and disinfecting or put disposable items in garbage.

## Step 6
Use the proper hand hygiene technique for 15 seconds.

## Step 7
Remove using the loops or ties without touching the mask. Place in garbage. Use the proper hand hygiene technique for 15 seconds.

- PPE must be removed slowly and deliberately in a sequence that prevents self-contamination. A step-by-step process should be developed and used during training and resident care.

Audits must be completed on Surge’s QRM system or HealthConnex for tracking purposes. For homes that do not have Surge, access can be obtained by clicking on the icons below:

Audits play a pivotal role in the IPAC program. Auditing practices, along with surveillance of infection data, can identify gaps and strengths in infection prevention practices.

## Responsibilities

- The home should designate champions to complete PPE audits monthly.
- These staff members must be educated on the donning and doffing procedures and the completion of audits on Surge.
- The ICP must evaluate and report on the home’s overall results at IPAC Committee Meetings and at PAC/MAC meetings quarterly.
- Compliance with donning and doffing practices must be reported, and plans for improvement initiated if compliance rates are <95%.
- Compliance rates are reported in the yearly evaluation of the home’s IPAC Program.

## Donning and Doffing Audits

- Donning audits can be completed at the discretion of the home to ensure PPE is worn properly and hand hygiene is completed.
- Compliance rates for doffing of PPE will be reviewed monthly, and action plans will be developed and implemented to increase compliance if needed.

# PPE Audit Process

## What does the audit process involve?
- The process begins with competency-based training
- Demonstration of selection of appropriate PPE
- Ability to locate PPE
- Demonstration of correct PPE donning and doffing sequence and practice
- Audits can provide immediate feedback and identify gaps in practice

## Feedback should be:
1. **Specific** – when a break in protocol is identified, it should be specific
2. **Timely** – immediate feedback is the most effective
3. **Non-threatening** – the feedback should be given in a manner that is non-threatening¹⁰
