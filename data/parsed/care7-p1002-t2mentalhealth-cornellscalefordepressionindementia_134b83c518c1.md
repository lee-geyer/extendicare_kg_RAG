# Mental Health - Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia

**Resident:**                            **Location:**                               **Score:** NA
**Category:** NA

## A. Mood-Related Signs
The scale is designed as a screening tool and is not diagnostic.
**2 steps:**
1. The clinician interviews the resident's caregiver on each of the 19 items of the scale. The caregiver is instructed to base his/her report on observations of the resident's behaviour during the week prior to the interview.
2. The clinician briefly interviews the resident.

**Total time of administration:** approximately 30 minutes
**For use with:** moderate to severely impaired elders with dementia.
The scale is valuable to demonstrate effectiveness of interventions, especially antidepressant treatment, when it is completed before the intervention and several weeks after.

# Major Depressive Episode Assessment

## Scoring Criteria
- A score >10 indicates a probably major depressive episode.
- A score >18 indicates a definite major depressive episode.

## Important Notes
- If there is a disagreement between the clinician's impression and the caregiver's report, the caregiver is interviewed again to clarify the source of discrepancy.
- Older persons often have disabilities or medical illnesses with symptoms and signs similar to those of depression.
- Scoring of the Cornell scale on items such as:
- Multiple physical complaints
- Appetite loss
- Weight loss
- Lack of energy
- Possibly others

may be confounded by disability or physical disorder. To minimize the assignment of falsely high Cornell scale scores in disabled or medically ill residents, raters are instructed to assign a score of "0" for symptoms and signs associated with these conditions.

- In many cases, the relationship between disability or illness is obvious. In some residents, this determination cannot be made reliably.
