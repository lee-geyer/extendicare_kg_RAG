## POLICY
Construction, renovation, and maintenance (CRM) activities must be assessed for infection risks prior to, during, and at the end of all CRM activities.

## STANDARD
Construction, renovation, and maintenance activities will be evaluated using the Infection Control Risk Assessment (ICRA) and this policy. An interdisciplinary team (IDT) shall be formed to develop an infection control plan, which includes the required preventive measures, and provide direction for the duration of CRM activities. The IDT’s membership will vary based on the scope of the project (e.g., day-to-day maintenance activities vs capital projects). Upon completion of all CRM activities, the Final Construction Clean tool will be used to ensure the final clean completed by the constructor is deemed satisfactory, after which the constructor will be allowed to remove barriers. Housekeeping shall perform a thorough terminal clean of the area following the same procedures as a discharge clean, as outlined in the Environmental Services Manual for housekeeping.

This policy is not intended to be used alone to address high-risk construction, renovation, maintenance activities that involve mould remediation and/or asbestos removal. For mould remediation and/or asbestos removal, a certified professional should be contracted.
