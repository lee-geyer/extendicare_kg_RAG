## What is Dysphagia?
- Difficulty swallowing, or Dysphagia, is common for residents in long-term care.
- Causes of Dysphagia include but are not limited to:
- Stroke
- Cerebral Palsy
- Parkinson’s disease
- Dementia
- Multiple Sclerosis
- People with Dysphagia may experience:
- Coughing
- Choking
- Aspiration when eating or drinking
- Difficulty chewing may also occur, which can further compromise swallowing. Dysphagia may lead to health complications such as:
- Malnutrition
- Dehydration
- Aspiration pneumonia

## Signs of Chewing and/or Swallowing Difficulty
- Avoidance of hard to chew/swallow foods
- Food or fluid leaking from the nose after swallowing
- Extra effort chewing or swallowing/increased time required for meal
- Pocketing food in the cheeks/spitting out/removing food from mouth
- Excessive chewing with no swallow initiation or delayed swallow
- Swallowing multiple times for a single mouthful of food
- Shortness of breath during eating
- Coughing, throat clearing, or choking while eating or drinking
- Drooling
- Refusing to eat or drink
- Complaints of pain or discomfort when eating or drinking
- Unplanned weight loss
- Dehydration
- Increased congestion in the chest after eating or drinking
- Repeated bouts of pneumonia

## Aspiration
Most people will cough if a foreign material (food, fluid, saliva, stomach contents) enters the airway/lungs (aspiration). The cough may be strong enough to remove the material and reduce the risk of developing pneumonia. However, silent aspiration (aspirating without coughing or signs of distress) may occur in people with dysphagia. Chest congestion and repeated bouts of pneumonia may be signals.

## Management of Dysphagia

- The Registered Dietitian (RD) will assess the resident’s chewing and swallowing ability; a referral will be made to a Speech Language Pathologist (SLP) if required or an RD is unavailable.
- Self-feeding or feeding techniques may be adjusted to increase ease of chewing and/or swallowing.
- A texture modified diet and/or thickened fluids may be suggested to ease chewing/swallowing and reduce the risk of choking and/or aspiration.
- Texture modified diets and thickened fluids are prepared from regular menu items and contain similar calories and nutrients.

### Common modified food textures include:

#### Minced texture:
- Foods are minced, ground, finely chopped, mashed, or grated in a moist form that requires little or no chewing. Soft breads are included. Toast without crust may be considered appropriate for a minced texture.

#### Pureed texture:
- Foods are pureed to form a smooth homogenous consistency with the use of a blender or food processor. Items such as pudding or apple sauce are served in their original form.

#### Thickened fluid/liquids:
- Starch or gum-based thickeners are used in hot or cold fluids to reach the desired consistency which may be handled better than thin. Consistencies include:
- Thin/Regular
- Mildly Thick/nectar-like
- Moderately thick/honey-like
- Extremely thick/pudding-like.

- The RD/SLP/OT (Occupational Therapist) may also recommend assistive feeding devices such as special utensils, cups, and/or plates to assist the resident to eat and drink more safely and easily.
