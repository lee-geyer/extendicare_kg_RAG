## Outbreak Playbook for Sales Consultants

The Executive Director (ED) or designate will contact confirmed move-ins and the Sales Consultant (SC) will contact scheduled tours to further explain the term “Outbreak” to them. For the general public, this often conjures up worst-case scenarios, and we want to educate them and help them understand what we do during outbreak periods to protect our residents. Suggested scripts are written below for use by various members of the team. These can be adjusted to the type of outbreak.

Sales consultants are not always required to be in the building during the outbreak. The working location of the sales consultant during this time will be determined by the Regional Director of Sales.

### For Move-Ins (confirmed)

Move-ins will proceed as scheduled if it is safe to do so. If move-ins are required to cease during an outbreak, it will be determined by:

- **The resident themselves**: The resident may choose to delay if they have concerns.
- **The Care needs**: If the new resident requires extensive care needs which the care team is unable to support during the outbreak, there will need to be a conversation between the RMHW and the RDS. The final decision will be made by the RMHW.
- **Size of the Outbreak**: In the case of a larger outbreak, the decision to determine which move-ins should be delayed will be determined by the RMHW.
- **Public Health Guidelines**: If there are directions given by public health, those guidelines will need to be followed, and there will need to be a conversation with the site and the regional team to determine which move-ins will proceed and which will be postponed until it is safe to do so.

The ED should call the prospect and/or SDM explaining the Outbreak and what precautions are in place to protect them.

### Example Communications:

> Mr. /Mrs. Smith – we are looking forward to you joining our residence on [X date]. We want to let you know that currently our building is in Outbreak for [Y]. What this means is that we have residents who we are closely monitoring and caring for that are showing cold or flu symptoms [insert type of flu].
>
> [Home name] has very high standards on managing Outbreak in our building, and here are some of the extra precautions we are putting in place to ensure our residents stay healthy and happy. To ensure you have a worry-free move-in, we wanted to call and explain the actions we take during this time.
>
> Your suite, appliances, and handrails outside your new home have had a stringent cleaning that exceeds public health agency requirements. A normal precaution is to remind all our residents to...
