## POLICY
### Restorative Care

### PROCEDURE
Respiratory therapy services will focus on supporting and enhancing residents’ quality of life by maintaining and/or improving respiratory function through a restorative care approach. This approach emphasizes resident strengths, promotes independence, and maximizes participation in meaningful Activities of Daily Living (ADLs).

1. The interRAI assessment must be completed by the interdisciplinary team, including a review of relevant respiratory indicators such as:
- Dyspnea
- Oxygen use
- ADL performance
- Diagnoses
- Recurring respiratory infections
- Any assessment protocols

2. The nurse conducting the interRAI review must refer to the Restorative Care Coordinating Committee, where the Restorative Care Lead will complete the Restorative – Needs Assessment & Evaluation to determine the resident’s capacity for improvement and suitability for restorative respiratory therapies.

3. The Restorative Care Co-Lead, in collaboration with the interdisciplinary team, may also coordinate referrals and assessments by Extendicare’s preferred respiratory service provider as needed.

4. Based on assessment outcomes, the most appropriate pulmonary exercises and treatments must be identified. This includes the implementation and training for any necessary respiratory equipment.

5. Restorative respiratory therapies are not intended as passive treatments, but are intended as function-enhancing supports, emphasizing resident engagement and active participation. Restorative respiratory interventions may include the following:

- **Breathing retraining techniques:**
- Diaphragmatic breathing
- Pursed-lip breathing

- **Therapy devices and methods:**
- Incentive spirometry
- Chest physiotherapy
- Postural drainage
- Non-invasive ventilation (e.g., CPAP/BiPAP)
- Nebulizer treatments (e.g., bronchodilators, saline)

6. An individualized plan of care must be developed with the resident and/or Substitute Decision Maker (SDM)/Power of Attorney (POA) based on assessment findings. Plans must specify treatment types, frequency, and duration.

- The Restorative Care Co-Lead or designate must evaluate intervention effectiveness monthly, with integration into quarterly reviews and the Restorative – Care Needs Assessment and Evaluation. Evaluation criteria must include:
- Changes in respiratory symptoms
- Functional improvements (e.g., increased ADL participation)
- Resident feedback on comfort, participation, and progress toward goals

### Documentation and Communication
- Significant changes or concerns in respiratory status (e.g., increased dyspnea, decreased oxygen saturation) must be documented in the resident’s health record and communicated to the physician or Nurse Practitioner (NP) in a timely manner.
- Respiratory therapy outcomes must be reviewed during Restorative Care Coordinating Committee meetings, which may include:
- Number of residents with documented respiratory goals
- Reductions in respiratory symptoms
- Maintenance or improvement in ADL self-performance

### Staff Training
- Staff responsible for delivering respiratory interventions must receive initial training, with refreshers and ongoing competency evaluations to ensure safe, evidence-based care as needed.
