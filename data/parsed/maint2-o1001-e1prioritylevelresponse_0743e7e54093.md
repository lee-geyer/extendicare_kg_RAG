# Extendicare Demand Maintenance
## Priority Level Response

Based on the four basic levels of priority, the following procedures should be followed:

### 1. EMERGENCY PRIORITY SERVICE

#### a. Reporting Emergencies:
- If an emergency problem is discovered, any staff person, including maintenance staff who is first made aware of it, shall report the problem to his or her immediate supervisor.
- If the immediate supervisor is not available, the problem shall be reported to the person designated as overseeing the building, either the Executive Director or the designate.
- If these people are not available, the problem shall be reported to the home’s Regional Director and/or the Extendicare Asset Management Department.
- If these people are not available, the problem shall be reported to the Vice-President of Operations.

#### b. Response During Normal Operating Hours:
- The supervisor, Executive Director or designate shall evaluate the reported incident and, if it is believed to truly be an emergency, notify the maintenance staff immediately by the quickest means possible, such as by overhead paging, walkie-talkie, mobile phone, cell phone, in person, etc.
> **Note:** In case of doubt, it is best to treat the situation as an emergency until one is confident that it is not.
- If maintenance staff are not in the facility, follow the procedure for 'outside normal operating hours', listed below.
- Explain the location and nature of the emergency to the maintenance staff, wait for the evaluation and recommendation of the maintenance department and, if necessary, evaluate the need to call an outside agency or contractor to help resolve the problem. The Extendicare Asset Management Department may also be contacted for advice and assistance with evaluating or resolving the problem.
- Maintenance staff shall respond to the emergency, evaluate the situation, and determine the most appropriate response. If it is an action that maintenance staff can easily undertake (such as shutting off a water valve), then the maintenance person shall do what is required. If it is an action that requires an outside contractor (such as repairing a gas leak) then the maintenance person shall take whatever action possible within his or her permissible scope to make the situation immediately safe (such as shutting off a gas valve), and then report to the Executive Director or designate the need for an outside agent to further the repairs.

#### c. Response Outside of Normal Operating Hours:
- The staff person who is initially made aware of the situation, or the supervisor who is informed by the staff person, shall contact the Executive Director or designate on call and advise the Executive Director or designate of the nature and location of the emergency, the status of the building, and the status of the residents affected by the emergency.
- If the Executive Director or designate on call is not available, then the staff person or supervisor shall contact the maintenance person on call.
- The Executive Director, or designate on call, will evaluate the reported incident and, if it is believed to truly be an emergency, contact the maintenance person on call or a listed service company to take immediate action to initiate repairs by:
- having the maintenance person on call return to perform work; or
- arranging for the proper outside service from a contractor.

# Demand Maintenance

## Priority Level Response
- The Executive Director or designate on call must also notify the Regional Director of the emergency and may contact the Extendicare Asset Management Department for advice or assistance.

## 1. HIGH PRIORITY SERVICE
If a problem is discovered that is determined to be high priority:
- The maintenance staff shall respond to the problem by:
1. evaluating the situation; and
2. determining the most appropriate response.
- If there is an action that the maintenance staff can easily undertake (such as shutting off a water valve or turning off a piece of equipment) to prevent further deterioration of the situation, then the maintenance person shall do what is required.
- The maintenance person shall then evaluate the immediate impact that the problem has on the home and its occupants and determine:
1. if a short-term alternate action is required; and
2. if an outside agent or contractor will be required to repair the problem.
- The maintenance person shall discuss his or her recommendations with his or her immediate supervisor or the Executive Director or designate.
- On the direction of the supervisor, Executive Director or designate, the maintenance person shall have the problem repaired or invite a contractor to provide a quotation on the cost of the repairs.

## 2. REGULAR AND ROUTINE PRIORITY SERVICE
The majority of items entered in the Maintenance Request Log should fall into this category:
- Maintenance request logs must be reviewed regularly, at a minimum once each working day.
- The maintenance supervisor shall assign a priority, as described in the proceeding pages, to each item listed in the maintenance request logs. All of the higher priority items shall be addressed first, and lower priority items addressed only after the higher priority items have been resolved.
- The maintenance supervisor shall schedule similar work to be done consecutively so that all work requiring similar tools or inventory can be done without needing to change equipment, such as replacing all damaged light bulbs one after another or doing all the repairs in one area while in that area.
- The supervisor shall also consider the scheduled Preventive Maintenance tasks required in an area where Demand Maintenance is requested. If possible, the maintenance worker shall carry out both the Preventive and Demand maintenance concurrently while working on any piece of equipment, system, or area of the building.
- The Maintenance Manager/Designate shall assign this work to the maintenance staff in a way that allows the staff to be most efficient with their time.
- If someone in the Maintenance Department carries out emergency work or initiates a repair that is not recorded in the Maintenance Request Log, then the work shall be entered into the Maintenance Request Log at a convenient time, either before or shortly after the work is completed, for the purpose of maintaining the maintenance record.
- Priority or routine maintenance shall be performed during normal working hours, as directed by the daily work routine. Every reasonable effort shall be made to complete the service on the day requested and according to the priority assigned.

# Demand Maintenance
## Priority Level Response

- Work completed must be recorded in the Maintenance Request Log, with comments as necessary.
- Work not completed in a given day shall be carried forward for completion in subsequent days. Periodically (suggested weekly), the Maintenance Department shall bring all unfinished work to the attention of the Supervisor, Executive Director or designate for assignment of priorities. The Extendicare Asset Management Department may be contacted as required for technical or procedural questions.
- If equipment repairs cannot be completed immediately, maintenance staff must:
1. Evaluate the risk of allowing the continued use of the equipment while it awaits repairs;
2. Tag the defective equipment with a lock-out tag if it is deemed to be unsuitable for use;
3. Either remove the tagged equipment to a secure designated area or take necessary precautions to prevent use of the equipment by residents, staff or visitors until repairs can be made;
4. Inform the appropriate staff of the nature of the problem and any precautions taken.
- The Executive Director may elect to have only department heads enter requests directly on Maintenance Request Log forms at centralized locations or allow all staff members access to the Maintenance Request Log forms. All completed Maintenance Request Log forms shall be periodically compiled in a separate binder to preserve a reasonable chronological order. Individual Maintenance Request Log forms do not need to be retained for longer than 3 years.
- Status of work requests provided on the Maintenance Request Log should be reported to the department that initiated the request. It is important that any equipment that is tagged out of service be reported to the applicable Department Head or designated in a timely manner.
