# CODE BROWN
## Emergency Response - Chemical Spill/Hazardous Material

### What does it mean?
Code Brown is the phrase used to alert staff to a spill or leak involving a chemical, biological, or radioactive material that may pose a threat to your health or to the environment. This includes noxious odours/vapours.

### What do I do?
When a spill is discovered do not touch:
- Announce 3 times, “Code brown + location”
- Move people away from the spill to prevent exposure
- Isolate the area and deny entry
- Seek/provide medical attention if there are injuries
- Evaluate the spill:
- Assess for hazards such as fire, explosion or chemical fumes
- Stop source of spill if it can be done quickly and safely
- Notify your supervisor/the Incident Manager
- Contain the spill if possible; if not and the spill is unsafe, CALL 9-1-1

### Review it before you need it:
