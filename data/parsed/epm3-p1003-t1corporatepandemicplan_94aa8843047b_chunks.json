      "text": "# IntroductionPandemics spread around the world. A pandemic is distinguished by its scope. It becomes a worldwide epidemic, or pandemic, when a disease spreads easily and rapidly through many countries and regions of the world and affects a large percentage of the population where it spreads.A pandemic starts when a new infectious disease emerges that is different from common strains. Because people have no immunity to the new virus, it can spread quickly and infect hundreds of thousands of people. Pandemic viral infections often develop when an animal or bird virus is transmitted to humans and then the virus develops so that it can travel from human to human.The novel virus will have to be studied to determine the incubation period and how virulent the virus is. The length of time that the virus is contagious will vary as well. A pandemic virus can appear very similar to seasonal infections that already occur in our populations.
