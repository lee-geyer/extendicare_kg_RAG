# Extendicare Guidelines for Height Measurement

## Measuring Height

As a resident’s height changes over time, an accurate measurement should be taken, rather than using the resident’s, families, or substitute decision maker’s verbal report of height. In addition, height listed in any admission documentation should be verified by actual measurement. The ideal height measurement is a standing height as it reflects changes to a resident’s height over time. Unfortunately, not all residents can stand straight and tall, or have significant kyphosis that may detract from an accurate standing measurement.

Recumbent measurements (lying in bed) are not recommended as the accuracy of these measurements is best taken on a firm surface with a specific measuring tool.

For residents who can stand, height should be measured without shoes, standing on a flat surface with heels close together and legs as straight as possible, arms at sides, line of vision perpendicular to the body. The person should take a deep breath, and the height should be measured at the point of maximum inspiration.

## Arm Span

For residents who are unable to stand, approximate height can be measured using arm span. Height is approximately equal to the distance between the fingertips or the longest finger when arms are outstretched at shoulder height. Distance can also be measured from fingertip to mid sternum and multiplied by two. In the elderly, this reflects the person’s maximum height in adulthood, not necessarily their present height.

## Knee Height Calculation

For residents who are not able to stand, approximate height can be measured from bottom of heel to top of the knee with foot flexed or flat on floor and knee at 90-degree angle.

- **Men height in cm** = (2.02 × knee height, cm) – (0.04 × age) + 64.19
- **Women height in cm** = (1.83 × knee height, cm) – (0.24 × age) + 84.88

## Ulnar (Forearm) Calculation

An alternative to the Knee Height Calculation is the Ulnar measurement. This also can be used when the resident is unable to extend their arms, or the measurement of their leg is not practical.

Use length of forearm (ulna) to calculate height using the table below. This measurement reflects a person’s maximum height in adulthood and not necessarily their current height.

# Guidelines for Height Measurement

## Estimating Height from Ulna Length

Measure between the point of the elbow (olecranon process) and the midpoint of the prominent bone of the wrist (styloid process) (left side if possible).
