There is no need to dry separately.\n- **Note:** Where possible, maximize your laundry production by washing as much isolation linen together as possible. Ensure the washer is not overloaded. Do not wash isolation linen with any other linen.\n- Consider using a red bag to identify isolation linen so that it clearly stands out.\n- Never sort isolation linen. The collection bag should be placed inside the washer and emptied directly.\n- Never wash isolation linen with other linen.\n- Isolation linen sent down the laundry chute must be double bagged, impermeable, or a nylon bag plus a garbage bag.## EDUCATION",
