## Preventative Maintenance Program

### PROCEDURE

#### The Monthly Calendar

- Preventive maintenance routine activities are cyclical in nature and therefore can be well defined and scheduled in advance. Routine activities depend on the specific characteristics of the physical plant, the type of equipment, and any specific responsibilities as detailed in the Job Descriptions in effect. Once the individual checklists for the key equipment and systems have been developed, the Maintenance Department shall develop a daily work routine and a Monthly Calendar to schedule essential routine activities. A sample of a blank monthly calendar is available as a Tool named “Monthly Maintenance Calendar”.

- When setting up a monthly calendar, it is advised to schedule little or, if possible, no work on Mondays or Fridays, since these days are frequently filled with non-routine or emergency work.

- The work from all of the maintenance task lists should be relatively evenly distributed across the remaining work-days of the month. Some tasks can be done relatively quickly, while others can take much more time. Evenly distributing the work does not mean having the same number of tasks each day, but rather having tasks that require, in total, the same amount of time each day.

- It is also advisable to try to group similar tasks together. For example, several kitchen maintenance items should be scheduled for the same day, since that work may need to be done after hours when the kitchen is not being used; various tasks to complete on the roof may be scheduled for the same day, since tools, filters, etc. will be transported to the roof to do this work.

- It is very important to realize that the monthly calendar is a guide and not a fixed schedule. There are many events that can occur to prevent a fixed schedule from being followed. Examples of some typical distractions are:
- vacations
- sickness
- problems within the home such as outbreak
- visits from government inspectors, accreditation agencies, etc.

- If an event occurs that prevents scheduled maintenance from taking place on the day listed, then that maintenance should be carried out on some other day of the month when it is convenient. If a particular preventive maintenance task cannot be completed in any one month, it can be deferred to the next month, provided that task is not avoided two months in a row.

## PROCEDURE

### SECTION: Preventative Maintenance Program
### DESCRIPTION: Calendar Scheduling
### INDEX: MAINT1-O10.03

- The maintenance check-sheets for the equipment have a separate number for each procedure. The calendar can be completed by writing the appropriate number in one square of the monthly calendar, indicating that procedure should be completed on that day, and other procedures in other squares.
- All the maintenance procedures used by a facility should have the numbers spread evenly over the available workdays of the month. It is recommended that no procedures be scheduled for Mondays or Fridays, since those days tend to be more likely to have many repair requests and other interruptions. It is also recommended that work of a similar nature be scheduled for the same day. For example, it might be more convenient if all work in the kitchen were scheduled on the same day.
- Assorted colours can be used to indicate that some procedures are quarterly, semi-annual, or annual maintenance, or the procedure number can be followed by a letter (Q, S, or A) to indicate that a more intensive maintenance procedure will be done.
- It must be remembered that these calendars are intended to help schedule the regular preventive maintenance but cannot be expected to predict all the unexpected events in the life of the facility. It will often happen that an event may prevent some maintenance from being completed on the day it was scheduled. This includes such things as visits from regulatory officials, sickness or vacation, sudden emergencies such as a heating system failure, etc. When this happens, the maintenance workers are expected to be flexible and deal with the issue, then carry out the preventive maintenance at another time or another day later in the month.
- There may be times when the preventive maintenance for a particular piece of equipment cannot be carried out during that month. This is not unusual and, in most situations, not critical to the operation of the equipment. However, if a particular procedure cannot be completed one month, then it should not be missed the following month.

#### Annual Calendar
- It is the responsibility of the Maintenance Manager/Designate to coordinate annual preventive maintenance checks of equipment by the equipment vendor.
