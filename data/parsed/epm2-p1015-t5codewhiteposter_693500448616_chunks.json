Staff need to call a Code White when facing a situation that makes them feel unsafe or creates a fear of violence due to the behaviour of another person. The goal is to preserve everybody’s safety, and to address the behaviour in a safe, respectful, and caring manner.### What do I do? If you are involved in a Code White incident:\n- Remain calm and leave the area if able to do so\n- If you cannot leave, maintain a safe distance from the aggressor\n- Call for help and announce 3 times, “Code White + location” if able\n- Talk in a low non-threatening voice.",
