A multi-drug resistant organism is a microorganism that has developed resistance to the action of several antimicrobial agents and is of special clinical or epidemiologic significance. Organisms classified as an MDRO include MRSA, VRE, EBSL, CPE, C. diff, and C. auris.## Who can get an MDRO? Most MDRO infections occur among people in hospitals and other healthcare settings. Outbreaks are thought to be more common in healthcare settings because they often affect people who are older, are very ill, have a compromised immune system, or suffer from chronic conditions which make them more susceptible to infection.## How is an MDRO transmitted? Most often, MDROs spread from resident to resident on the hands of healthcare workers. They can also spread by contact with contaminated objects such as medication cart handles, bed rails, bedside tables, IV poles, and catheters, etc. They can also transmit person-to-person through direct physical contact.",

Proper hand hygiene and contact precautions reduce the risk of transmission.## How does drug resistance occur? When antibiotics are used frequently, or for lengthy periods of time, microorganisms can develop resistance and will not be destroyed by certain drugs. This can occur when someone is given a prescription of antibiotics and does not complete the course/dosage (i.e., stops taking them) because they begin to feel better. Microorganisms may not be completely killed and, in this way, they can develop resistance to the drug.## How to monitor an MDRO? Extendicare’s Infection Surveillance policy requires tracking and documenting of all infections daily. The policy also sets out requirements for determining trends by reviewing, analyzing, and comparing the infection rates to the previous two months in addition to the same month of the previous year.",

Candida auris is an emerging fungal pathogen capable of causing invasive disease, particularly in critically ill patient populations. Following recognition of this pathogen in Japan in 2009, it has spread globally resulting in persistent and difficult to control hospital outbreaks. Unlike Candida albicans, the majority of C. auris isolates are resistant to fluconazole. Resistance to other azoles, polyenes (e.g., amphotericin B) and echinocandins also occurs. There is little available information on how antifungal resistance is acquired in C. auris but the development of resistance while on therapy has been observed.### Who is at Risk of C. auris? Residents at risk for C. auris include those who:\n- have had recent surgeries;\n- are diabetic;\n- use broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals;\n- have invasive medical devices such as breathing tubes, feeding tubes, and central venous catheters; and\n- have frequently stays in health care settings, particularly in long-term acute care hospitals and long-term care homes that provide ventilator care.### How C. auris is spread\nC.",

Transmission through indirect contact can also occur after handling contaminated material or equipment. C. auris is not spread through the air but can persist on surfaces and multi-use equipment for extended periods of time. Risk factors for C. auris acquisition should be identified for any resident who tests positive for C. auris, including prior hospitalization or receipt of health care (e.g., dialysis, day surgery) at a Canadian health care facility where C. auris transmission has occurred, or a health care facility outside Canada. ``````markdown",

C. difficile is a bacterium that causes diarrhea and more serious intestinal conditions like colitis (or inflammation of the colon). It is one of the most common diarrheal infections in hospitals and long-term care homes. The bacterium was formerly (2016) named Clostridium difficile.Most cases of C. difficile occur in persons who are taking certain antibiotics in high doses or over a prolonged period of time. Some antibiotics can destroy a person’s normal bacteria found in the gut, allowing C. difficile bacteria to grow.### How C. diff is Transmitted\nC. difficile is found in stool and is transmitted from one person to another by direct contact (unwashed hands) or through indirect contact after handling contaminated material or equipment. Healthy people do not usually get C. difficile. Those with other illnesses or conditions requiring antibiotics and the elderly are at greater risk.### How Antibiotic Use Contributes to the Development of C. diff\nTreatment with antibiotics alters the normal levels of good bacteria that are naturally found in the intestines and colon.

False negative results occur when specimens are not kept refrigerated until testing can be done. - Transport specimens as soon as possible and store at 2 - 8 °C until tested.

There are specific bacteria that produce enzymes called Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase (ESBLs). These enzymes can break down many common antibiotics and make them ineffective in fighting infection caused by bacteria. Certain strains of *E. coli* produce ESBL (these do not include the strain of *E. coli* that causes food poisoning). Another bacterium, *Klebsiella*, also produces ESBL however slightly different than those produced by *E. coli*. Frequent and prolonged use of antibiotics can cause this resistance to develop.### Clinical Presentation of ESBL\nESBL producing bacteria can cause urinary tract infections, wound infections or pneumonia. These infections can sometimes progress to cause more serious infections such as septicemia which can be life threatening. ESBLs break down the commonly prescribed antibiotics used to treat these common infections. This potentially allows the infection to worsen and there is increased risk of mortality.### Risk Factors for ESBL\nESBL-producing bacteria do not usually cause illness in healthy individuals.",

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a type of bacteria that is commonly found on the skin and in the noses of healthy individuals. Some Staph bacteria are easily treated while others are not. Staph bacteria that are resistant to several antibiotics, such as Methicillin, are known as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA. Some infections caused by S. aureus include:- cellulitis\n- pustules\n- carbuncles\n- impetigo\n- bacteremia\n- endocarditis\n- wound infections\n- less commonly pneumoniaPus or drainage from lesions or any other body substances containing the organism are potentially infectious.S. aureus is transmitted primarily through direct person-to-person contact, especially through the hands of healthcare workers. Nasal carriage of S. aureus is very common and may be due to hand-to-nose transmission. A nasal carrier often contaminates his/her own hands by hands-to-nose contact and then transmits the organism during routine activities.",

Since skin-to-skin contact is the most significant mode of transmission, hand hygiene is of primary importance in preventing the spread of MRSA.### Mode of MRSA Transmission\nThe primary mechanism for transmission of MRSA from one resident to another is via healthcare workers whose hands have become transiently colonized. Hands may become contaminated after direct contact with colonized or infected residents while performing resident care, when removing gloves, or touching contaminated surfaces. On occasion, residents may acquire MRSA from direct contact with contaminated surfaces.### How to Decrease the Risk of MRSA Transmission\nThe risk of transmission of MRSA can be reduced by following routine practices including strict compliance with hand hygiene and contact precautions. It is also very important for residents, visitors, families, and volunteers to perform hand hygiene.```markdown",
