It focuses on preventing and relieving suffering through the early identification, assessment, and treatment of symptoms. Palliative care spans the entire illness trajectory, from diagnosis and treatment to end-of-life care and bereavement support.In long-term care, a palliative approach ensures that residents with life-limiting illnesses can experience a high quality of life from admission to the end of their lives.",
