## Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) Risk Assessment

### RISK ASSESSMENT:
Complete the following review with the Multidisciplinary team for each potential move-in/re-admissions with confirmed/suspected CPE or known CPE exposure. This risk assessment is an information gathering tool intended to support decision making and risk identification and management of CPE prior to move-in/re-admission.

**Note:** organism may be reported as CPO, CRE, CPE

# Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) Risk Assessment

## Risk Assessment Questions

- Are intact?
- Is this an older building where cleaning & disinfection are a challenge?
- Are there challenges with housekeeping?

## Disinfectant Availability

- Home has access and is able to change to a disinfectant for affected resident care area with a kill claim for CPE?
i.e., Oxivir TB

## Reporting

- Home has notified Infection Control Specialist of possible, suspect, or confirmed CPE resident?
- Ontario only – notify local health unit of suspect or confirmed case? (CPE is a Reportable Disease in Ontario)
