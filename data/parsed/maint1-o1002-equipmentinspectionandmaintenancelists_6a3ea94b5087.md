## POLICY

### Preventative Maintenance Program

### PROCEDURE

- Once a list of key equipment and systems has been created, the Maintenance Department shall develop a program of daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual tasks that are required to properly maintain each piece of equipment or each system.
- This list of tasks can be obtained from many sources:
- Recommendations from the equipment manufacturer
- Recommendations from the equipment supplier
- Recommendations from tradesmen skilled in maintaining this type of equipment
- Recommendations of best practice from trade magazines and books
- Recommendations of best practice from course instructors in technical schools
- Sample lists of recommended procedures from reliable sources.
- Within this Preventative Maintenance policy, there are sample Inspection Checklists that would be typical for much of the equipment listed above. These inspection checklists can be used to develop an effective preventive maintenance program for most of the systems and equipment found in a typical Extendicare long-term care home. All checklists/tools will provide direction and guidance to maintenance staff.

> **Note:** Some of the equipment listed in the Inspection Checklists may be mutually exclusive and may not be provided in some buildings.

- Some of the features that should be noticed about the sample “Inspection Checklists” listed in the section are:
1. Each piece of equipment is uniquely identified at the top of the page indicating what the equipment is (e.g. "Boiler").
2. Each piece of equipment is uniquely identified (e.g. "Unit No."). If there are two or more similar pieces of equipment, each would have its own page of information.
3. A description of what tasks are to be done (e.g. "test operation of the following...") and how frequently (e.g. 'W' for weekly, 'M' for monthly, etc.);
4. A brief calendar that provides a visual reference to determine whether the weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual and annual tasks have been done for that piece of equipment.
5. A place on the back of the page where it can be recorded that a series of tasks were done (e.g. item numbers), the condition of the equipment (e.g. “key”), the date the tasks were performed and the signature of the person performing them.
6. Although other systems can be developed to schedule and record this type of maintenance, the selected system should have the attributes described above. At present, there are several computerized maintenance management programs available; however, many of them do not have adequately detailed work descriptions, are difficult to modify to include new pieces of equipment and take more effort to support than a simple paper system.

# PROCEDURE

## SECTION: Preventative Maintenance
### DESCRIPTION: Equipment Inspection and Maintenance
### INDEX: MAINT1-O10.02

Most computerized systems work well for large maintenance departments with many maintenance workers but become overly bureaucratic for departments with only two or three workers. In general, these systems appear to be designed to be more supportive of non-routine Demand Maintenance than regular Preventive Maintenance.
