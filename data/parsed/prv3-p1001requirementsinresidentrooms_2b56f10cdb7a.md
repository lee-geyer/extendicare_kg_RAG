## POLICY

### Video Surveillance

## PROCEDURE

The Executive Director / Director of Care or Delegate / All Staff (together, “Home Staff”) are hereby made aware that only a resident or his/her substitute decision maker (SDM) is permitted to install a video recording/surveillance device (“device”) in the resident’s room, at the resident’s own cost. The home cannot install any devices in a resident room without express consent from the resident/SDM. Therefore, the Home Staff will ensure that:

- The resident/SDM review and sign the Video Surveillance Agreement before the installation of the device. See the Video Surveillance Agreement tool.
- A signed copy of the Video Surveillance Agreement is stored in the resident’s records. If the resident/SDM chooses not to sign the agreement, Home Staff will note in the resident’s records the date the agreement was reviewed with the resident/SDM.
- The resident/SDM is aware that the home’s Wi-Fi may not be used for operating video devices. The resident/SDM will be responsible for supplying his/her own transmission needs.
- The Video Surveillance Device Roommate Consent Form is signed prior to any devices being installed in shared rooms.
- The placement of the device is reviewed by Home Staff with the resident/SDM to ensure the protection of resident privacy. The device must be placed in a way that does not accidentally capture audio or video of others outside of the resident’s room.
- The device is turned off or covered up during personal care.
- Signage is posted in the resident’s room informing residents, staff, and visitors of the presence of a device. See Resident Room Recording Device Notice tool.
- Resident/SDM is informed that audio recording is illegal unless one of the parties involved in that conversation consents to the recording. Home Staff shall recommend that audio recording be disabled on all surveillance equipment.
- They notify home leadership if a hidden device is discovered in a resident room. The supervisor will contact the resident/SDM to determine if they are aware of the device.
- If Resident/SDM are found to be aware of the presence of the device, the home will review the Video Surveillance Agreement with the resident/SDM.
- If the resident/SDM is not aware of the device, the device will be removed from the resident’s room immediately.
- Resident/SDM is made aware that posting of images or video recordings of staff, other residents, or visitors in any location that can be viewed by the public (e.g., social media) is not allowed without the consent of everyone in the video or image.
