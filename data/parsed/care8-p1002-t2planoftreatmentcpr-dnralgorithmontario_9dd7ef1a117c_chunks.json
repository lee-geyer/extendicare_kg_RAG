Explain that:\n- CPR is an aggressive procedure which can work well in cases where the person is fairly healthy.\n- CPR can be successful when the person’s heart suddenly stops beating normally and a health care provider or someone trained in CPR is on hand to begin CPR immediately. Studies have shown that only about 12 out of every 100 patients who receive CPR while in the hospital live through the procedure and are able to go home. Only 1-4% of persons with chronic illness will survive.\n- Those whose hearts stop outside of hospital have a significantly lower chance of survival. The benefits of CPR are virtually zero for those who suffer unwitnessed heart stoppage (no one trained in CPR present when the heart stops).\n- CPR will not help those who are at the natural end of their lives due to a progressive life limiting illness.",

Breathing machines require a tube about the size of one's thumb to be placed into the person's airway. Tubes in the airway prevent the person from being able to talk while the machine is breathing for him or her. Depending on the severity of the brain damage, the machine for breathing may not be able to be removed.\n- **Possible side effects:**\n- Broken ribs\n- Punctured lung\n- Pain from trauma to chest\n- **Alternative courses of action:**\n- Excellent care and appropriate medical interventions that respect the person’s goals related to comfort, prolonging life, and which address physical, emotional and spiritual needs will be offered.\n- **Consequences of not having CPR:**\n- Palliative support will be given as natural death occurs.",
