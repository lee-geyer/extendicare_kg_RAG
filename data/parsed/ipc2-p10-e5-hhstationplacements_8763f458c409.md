# Alcohol-Based Hand Rub (ABHR) Considerations

## A) Areas for ABHR Installation
- **Entrance**
- **Exit from soiled side** (away from the hand hygiene sink)
- **Inside the clean side**
- **Maintenance rooms**
- **Staff locker rooms**
- **Entrance/exit to the garbage dumpster**

## B) Other Areas Where ABHRs Would Be Expected (Which Can Be Portable)
- **Medication carts**
- **Nourishment carts**

## C) Design Considerations When Installing ABHR Dispensers
- They must be mounted at a height of approximately 1m (or a little higher) from the floor (i.e., easily reachable by all staff).
- They must not be installed near sources of electricity (e.g., plugs) or sources of fire (e.g., near a stove).
- Wall protectors should be installed on adjacent walls for protection.
- ABHR dispensers must not be installed near sinks or hand washing facilities.
- This is to avoid mistakenly mixing water with ABHR, which dilutes the product and does not achieve its purpose.
- Dispensers must not be installed inside areas where hand washing (not sanitizing) is expected, such as:
- Areas with gross or visible soiling (e.g., in the soiled utility room, washrooms, spa rooms).
- Areas where chemicals are prepared (e.g., housekeeping rooms).
- Areas where food is prepared or consumed (e.g., breakrooms, kitchens, and serveries).
- Dispensers can be installed at the entrances to those areas but not inside.
- The only exception is the laundry room where an ABHR might be needed near the exit of the room.
