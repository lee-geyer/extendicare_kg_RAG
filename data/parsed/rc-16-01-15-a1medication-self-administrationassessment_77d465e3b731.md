| Resident: | Effective Date: | Location: |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Physician: |                 |           |

## AA. Medications
- **List all medications being assessed for self-administration:**

## A. Assessment

### Demonstrated cognitive capacity:
1. Select all that apply:
- Oriented to person, place and time
- Follows multi-step instructions
- No signs of delirium or fluctuating cognition
- Requires reminders or cueing to prompt timing for daily tasks
- Refuses education or assistive devices (e.g., pill organizer, checklists)
- Moderate to severe cognitive impairment (CPS of 3 or greater)

### Physical abilities to self-administer medications:
2. Has the manual dexterity to open medications with or without assistive device (e.g., packages, lids, containers):
- Yes
- No
- Provide details: (if known)

3. Has the ability to self-administer medications independent of physical assistance (e.g., oral, topical, inhaler, injection):
- Yes
- No
- Provide details:

4. Has adequate vision to read labels with or without visual aids (e.g., glasses):
- Yes
- No
- Provide details:

5. Resident has no fine motor impairment:
- Yes
- No
- Provide details:

6. Uses adaptive devices successfully (e.g., pill organizer):
- Yes
- No
- N/A
- Provide details:

## B. Competency Evaluation
- Ask the resident direct questions to effectively evaluate the resident's competency to self-administer medication safely and independently:
1. Understands ALL medications and indications for use (i.e., purpose):
- Yes
- No
2. Understands the potential side effects of each medication:
- Yes
- No
3. Understands the appropriate route of administration for each medication (e.g., oral, topical, inhaler, injection):

# Medication Self-Administration Assessment

## A. Understanding of Medication

1. **Understands medication purpose**
- a. Yes
- b. No

2. **Understands medication side effects**
- a. Yes
- b. No

3. **Understands when to seek help (e.g., adverse reactions)**
- a. Yes
- b. No

4. **Understands incidents that must be reported to the nurse (e.g., missed or duplicate doses)**
- a. Yes
- b. No

5. **Understands medication storage requirements (i.e., safe and securely locked in drawer/cabinet in their room)**
- a. Yes
- b. No

## B. Additional Factors

### Complexity of Medication Regimen:
- Select all that apply:
- a. Is prescribed more than 5 different medications
- b. Medications scheduled more than TID (3 times/day)
- c. Different administration routes (e.g., pills, patches, inhalers, etc.)
- d. Medications require the use of specialized equipment (e.g., spacer for inhaler, glucose monitor)
- e. Medications require crushing, splitting or mixing
- f. Doses require titrating based on clinical response (e.g. Insulin sliding scale)
- g. PRN (as needed) medications
- h. High risk/high alerts medications (e.g., insulins, anticoagulants)
- i. Frequent dose or schedule changes in last 3 months
- j. None of the above

## C. Outcome/Planning

### a. Scoring Outcome
- Low Risk - Approved for self-administration
- Moderate Risk - Approved with support interventions
- High Risk Score - Not approved
- Unsafe factors - Not approved

### b. Approved with support interventions
- **Focus:** Medication - Self-Administration
- **Goal:** Resident goal(s) (SPECIFY) will be supported through to the next review.
- **Goal:** Resident will independently manage medications using assistive devices (e.g., pill organizer, reminder alarms) through to the next review.
- **Goal:** Resident will safely self-administer medications as prescribed without incident through to the next review.

### Interventions:
- Monitoring schedule in place: (SPECIFY nursing routine, e.g., visual observation of administration, regular review of residentâ€™s MAR, weekly checks for safe medication storage)
- Other strategies to support safe self-administration: (SPECIFY)
- Uses a medication organization tool to support independence (SPECIFY, e.g., pill organizer)
- Uses a reminder aid to support timely self-administration of medications (SPECIFY, e.g., talking alarm clock, phone reminder, visual chart, medication calendar).
- Uses an adaptive device to assist with physical limitations during medication handling (SPECIFY, e.g., easy-grip bottle opener, pill crusher, eye drop guide)
- Visual aid used to support safe medication identification (SPECIFY, e.g., color-coded labels, bold-print instructions, magnifier)

### c. Approved for self-administration
- Indicate under 'Self-Administration of Medication' special instructions
