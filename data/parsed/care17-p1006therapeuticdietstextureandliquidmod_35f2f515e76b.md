## POLICY

### Nutritional Care and Hydration

----

## PROCEDURE

The Registered Dietitian (RD) can order, without being co-signed by a physician, a therapeutic diet, texture modification or a change in a liquid (fluid) consistency based on the assessment of a resident’s nutritional status and needs.

The RD/designate must consider each resident individually, with reference to the resident’s personal goals, health status, benefits, risks of a therapeutic diet, and quality of life when assessing and determining an appropriate diet, texture, and liquid prescription. If required, specific, individualized interventions must be added to meet the resident’s individual needs, as assessed by the RD/designate.

If a resident requires interventions not currently offered, the RD, in consultation with the Culinary Manager (CM) or designate, will plan an individualized therapeutic menu as able.

If a resident has a significant number of dislikes/preferences, they may require an individualized menu to accommodate.

Proposed changes to diet, texture or liquid (fluid) consistency are discussed with the resident/SDM/POA. Changes are communicated to the CM and the interdisciplinary team.

### Thickened Liquids (Fluids)

- The RD, Speech Language Pathologist, or Occupational Therapist may recommend providing thickened liquids after a proper assessment has taken place.
- Thickened liquids are available in combination with any of the above-listed diets and textures.
- All liquids, including nutrition supplements and soups, must be provided in the correct consistency before administering or serving, as indicated in the resident’s plan of care. Some foods that can become a liquid, such as ice cream, may be substituted appropriately.
- To promote consistency in the quality of thickened liquids:
- Use of pre-thickened beverage products are recommended where available.
- Thickened liquids made “in house” must be prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions to reach desired consistency.
- Thickened beverages and soup are prepared in a centralized location such as in the culinary department.
- Thickened supplements may be prepared either by culinary staff or by the care staff providing the supplement (using manufacturer instructions).
- Standard liquid consistencies offered include:
- Thin Level 0 (TN0)/Regular
- Mildly Thick Level 2 (MT2)/Nectar-Like
- Moderately Thick Level 3 (M03)/Honey-Like
- Extremely Thick Level 4 (EX4)/Pudding-Like
- Thickened liquid menu substitutions are managed in the food service software application.
- The CM or designate must arrange education for the interdisciplinary team with education on preparing thickened liquids to correct consistencies. Education occurs during orientation and annually thereafter.
- The interdisciplinary team must monitor the resident’s swallowing abilities to ensure the consistency of thickened liquids remain appropriate.
- Residents who require thickened liquids are at greater risk for dehydration. Therefore, adequate liquids must be offered according to the resident’s plan of care.
