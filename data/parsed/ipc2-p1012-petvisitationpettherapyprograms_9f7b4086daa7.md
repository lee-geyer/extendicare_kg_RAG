## POLICY

### Infection Prevention

### PROCEDURE

This procedure is regarding the use of trained pets with handlers who are invited to visit the Home periodically.

- The following animals (not an all-inclusive list) are not permitted to live in or visit the home (dependent on provincial/regional requirements):
- Reptiles and amphibians (e.g., lizards, snakes, iguanas, turtles, frogs, and salamanders).
- Non-human primates.
- Hamsters, gerbils, mice, and rats.
- Hedgehogs, prairie dogs or any other recently domesticated animal species.
- Other animals not litter-trained or for which measures cannot be taken to prevent resident exposure to animal excrement.
- Other animals with behavioural or disease risks (e.g., raccoons, skunks, ferrets, and bats).

- Injuries caused by an animal shall be:
- Assessed and first aid provided by medical personnel.
- Reported to the owner/person responsible for the home’s pet program.
- Reported to the local Animal Control Authority and/or Public Health Department, as per local requirements.
- Recorded in the resident’s health record, as applicable.
- Recorded (follow the Adverse Event process to record the event) and reviewed by the home’s leadership team and Resident/Family council. It is the responsibility of the administrator to act in the best interests of the resident and animal in the event of an incident.
- Any animal that causes injury to any person in the home will be assessed for its appropriateness of living in or visiting the home.

- A staff person(s) will be designated to provide support to animal handlers and ensure all procedures are met by the owner during each visit. Visiting pet therapy animals must be in the owner’s home for at least six months to qualify for pet therapy.

- The animal handler should be provided with a bottle of alcohol-based hand sanitizer to carry with them during the pet therapy visit to encourage hand hygiene. All staff, residents, families, visitors, and volunteers shall practice hand hygiene before and after contact with pets.

# PROCEDURE

## SECTION: Infection Prevention
### DESCRIPTION: Pet Visitation (Pet Therapy) Programs
**INDEX:** IPC2-P10.12

- Pet therapy animals should not visit the home without their first set of vaccinations.
- Handlers must provide proof of their animal’s yearly check-up and documentation from a veterinarian to verify all vaccinations are up to date and the animal is healthy (unless a vaccine is deemed a contraindication due to the animal’s older age).
- Pet therapy animals must not visit the Home if they are experiencing the following symptoms from onset to at least one week beyond the resolution of:
- Episodes of vomiting or diarrhea
- Urinary or fecal incontinence
- Episodes of sneezing or coughing of unknown origin
- Open wounds
- Ear/eye infections
- Skin infections/lesions
- Enteric parasites
- Pet therapy animals visiting the Home shall be free of hookworms, fleas, ticks, or mange (mite infestation).
- Pet therapy animals visiting the home are not to be on a raw food diet.
- It is recommended animals be registered with a recognized pet therapy program. Animals not registered should be observed on a continuous basis by the visitation liaison to ensure the animal is well-trained and well-behaved. If there is any evidence of aggressive behaviour, immediately remove the animal from the Home.
- Pet therapy animals shall be leashed and supervised at all times when in the Home.
- Residents who do not wish to have contact with the pet therapy animals shall have documentation in their plan of care and may place signage on the door to their room.
- Every reasonable and practical effort shall be made to keep the pet therapy animals away from residents with allergies, phobias, or dislikes. Pet therapy animals are not allowed in dining rooms, medication rooms, resident bathrooms, or food preparation areas.
- In the case of accidental scratches, put measures in place to prevent this situation from reoccurring with the same animal.
- Visiting pet therapy animals should not be fed treats by the residents. This will be the responsibility of the pet handler to manage. Where possible, make every attempt to discourage visiting pet therapy animals from licking a resident’s skin. If a pet licks a resident, ensure the affected area is washed and hand hygiene occurs.
- Visiting Pet Therapy animals will not be scheduled for longer than one-hour visits to reduce animal fatigue.
