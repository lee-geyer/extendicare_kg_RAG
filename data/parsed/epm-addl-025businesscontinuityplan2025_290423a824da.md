# Section A: General Information

## A 1: Introduction

### What is a Business Continuity Plan?
A business continuity plan is a mixture of integrated systems and plans that enable a business to prevent and recover from threats. The purpose of the Business Continuity (BCP) is to ensure timely and orderly continuation or resumption of key operations when our home and our residents are impacted by unplanned or unanticipated incidents or events. This plan will be utilized upon anticipated or actual loss of access to critical resources required for service delivery and/or an absenteeism rate of >33% of employees for a period of 1 day or greater. This plan is designed to serve as a guide to prevent, prepare for, and recover from potential emergencies based on known hazards, risks, and available resources. It is intended that this plan be flexible enough to cater to a variety of situations.

Our organization’s objectives during an emergency are the following:
- Effectively prepare for an emergency
- Maintain essential operations and services
- Minimize the impact during an emergency
- Restore operational capabilities to pre-emergency levels

# 1.2 General Contingency Plan

The vast majority of service disruptions are process, system or building-specific. Most are of a local nature and result in short-term business continuity disruptions. They are primarily notable in that they restrict employees' access to key resources such as their workplace (to conduct ongoing business), their information systems (to process or retrieve critical data), or people (to coordinate an effective and timely response).

During an emergency or disaster situation, Extendicare will work in cooperation with the Region’s Emergency Services/Emergency Control Group and the City Fire Department and Corporate Office supports. The IT Business Continuity Plan and Pandemic Plan are also part of Extendicare’s business continuity planning. As per the Extendicare Emergency Preparedness and Management Manual, “Emergency Plans” policy, each home is to have a home-specific Emergency Response Plan (ERP) and Fire Safety Plan. These plans will comprehensively state the actions the home will take when faced with an emergency.

To complete this plan, each home conducts a Hazard Identification and Risk Analysis (HIRA) (see Procedure and Tool Hazard Identification and Risk Analysis attached to policy 1) to determine the most likely disasters or threats to the home. The ERP is then based on these threats and must also meet all provincial and national Fire Codes and IMS emergency response standards.

This home-specific ERP must include:
- Detailed roles and responsibilities during an emergency (including evacuation drills) every year;
- Arrangements with local authorities and institutions to provide shelter and resources;
- Alternate sources to supply emergency power, water, food, and fuel;
- A communications plan; and
- Resident identification procedures, including photographs and identification bracelets.

For homes with employees requiring accommodation due to a disability, please ensure the information is contained in the home-specific ERP; for Ontario homes, this is mandatory under the AODA.

# General Contingency Plan

## A 1.2.1 Extendicare Operational Planning Guidelines

To ensure business continuity in an emergency, short term planning is paramount. Emergency management and overall recovery are greatly improved if critical services are available without significant interruption. In the event of an emergency, it is important that core roles and core departments are available to keep critical parts of our programs operating. The following IMS roles are designed to help plan for this.

## A 1.2.2 IMS Roles

The Incident Manager in the home during the emergency is responsible to designate the roles within the home for the Incident Management and System (IMS) (see IMS, IMS Functions and Organization Chart Procedure attached to policy 1). The following roles must be designated to an area or individual and a backup individual in the event of an emergency:

- **Emergency Operations Centre** – During an emergency situation, the Emergency Operations Centre is the centralized operations centre. Homes must identify the centre(s) in their plan.

- **Incident Manager** – Responsible for overall management of the home in which the emergency situation occurs. The Incident Manager will assign IMS roles that mimic everyday staff routines and responsibilities as closely as possible.
- The Incident Manager may assume all of the roles/functions to meet the needs of the emergency or can designate a person to a role or roles.
- The designated person(s) can assume more than one role/function at a time based on the home’s staffing complement.
- The Incident Manager role must be assigned on all shifts.

- **Communications Officer** – In consultation with Extendicare’s Corporate Communications Department, the Communications Officer is responsible for the development and release of information about an incident to the public, families, stakeholders, and the media.

> **Note:** The Corporate Communications Department must approve all emergency information released.

# Emergency Response Policy

## 1.3 General Emergency Response Overview

Take all necessary action to maintain safety and protect residents, staff, families, and visitors.

- Call 911 if life/safety may be compromised.
- Assess the situation and decide the course of action using your emergency code job action checklists.

If required:
- Activate the ERP and complete the Situation Report from tab 4.
- Evacuate the home.
- Assess the availability of staff and supplies.

Following the immediate response:
- If necessary, conduct a damage assessment of the building, including supplies and utilities. Note that a Building Inspector has to give permission to re-enter a damaged/affected building after an incident.
- Complete the Incident Tracking Sheet from tab 4.
- Report actions to relevant parties.
- Conduct a debriefing meeting with staff.
- Depending on the situation, communication with families, media, and other stakeholders may be necessary; this will be done as per Extendicare’s Communications Protocol for Emergencies in tab 1.

Because emergency incidents are often rare and cannot be predicted, repeated exercises/drills are necessary to help employees feel comfortable and prepared to react without wasting time, as inaction may increase the impact of the emergency. Planning and execution of these exercises has to be based on the experience of real scenarios, it has to involve the workers, and they must be performed frequently to ensure that no one forgets the processes.

As per Extendicare’s policies, homes are...

# Emergency Planning and Management Program

## 1.4 BCP Review and Maintenance

This plan is intended to be a living document and as such must be reviewed on a regular basis. Each home specific ERP must be reviewed every 6 months and updated as required including a test of some aspects of the plan and annual exercises of each code. The Fire Safety Plan (FSP) must be reviewed and updated annually, including fire drill documentation from three drills per month and annual Code Green exercise. These plans must be reviewed and updated more frequently if changes occur to your environment or policy/legislated requirements are identified.

Extendicare has developed table top exercises related to specific emergency events which have been assessed as having a high impact on business continuity and can be used as emergency exercises to test components of your ERP.

A hard copy of the ERP and FSP will be stored in a designated location that is accessible and available to all team members and volunteers; these plans must be understood by all team members and volunteers, who must participate fully in emergency preparedness activities, training, drills and evacuation procedures.

The Administrator/ Executive Director/ Executive Director (or designate) will be responsible for the components of the plan that are home-specific. The ERP and FSP must be updated and reviewed as per policy; the Maintenance of Home Specific Emergency Response Plan and Fire Safety Plan Checklists (Appendix 1) can be used to ensure the full update of all required information in these plans.

# Section D: After the Emergency

## D 1: Recovery Action Planning

Recovery planning is the process undertaken to restore business as usual during and following an event. This includes the provision of equipment and supplies, etc. as well as the support and follow-up process required to ensure staff are able to continue in their duties.

Recovery processes are integral in the planning for the management of an incident. Recovery may be managed either internally or by external personnel, who may be utilized depending on the size or nature of the incident.

The staff managing the incident will direct recovery procedures. They will begin considering recovery requirements from the first incident command meeting based on the information from the BCP. A recovery plan will be developed in consultation with the Administrator/Executive Director/Executive Director, Regional Director, and VP, Operations.

- The **ALL CLEAR** should be communicated when all parties involved in the management of the incident response agree that the incident is resolved and all risks have been mitigated.
- Update all documentation.

Recovery also includes:
- Immediate incident analysis debrief sessions
- Event review
- Staff debriefing either in groups or individually as required
- Access to Employee Assistance Programs and other support services

A situation report will be written including:
- The nature of the event
- Action taken
- Individuals involved
- Details of any injuries/illnesses/fatalities
- Property damage or loss
- Estimate of costs and long-term impacts

# Recovery Process Guidelines

## Key Points to be Aware of in Relation to the Recovery Process

- It is recommended that all staff, service providers, and stakeholders who participated in a response also participate in the debrief sessions and event reviews.
- Staff involved in a response may not recognize the impact an incident has had on them and should be aware that the effects may emerge at any time during or following an event.
- The leadership team should actively follow up with involved staff who should be encouraged to utilize the follow-up support processes available within the organization.
