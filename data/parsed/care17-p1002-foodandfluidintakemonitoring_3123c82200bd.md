2. The interdisciplinary team is to provide and encourage food and liquid intake consistently throughout the day and when awake at night.
3. The care staff must document food and liquid intake each shift, including activities and during the night shift. The nurse/delegate must review resident daily intake records and consider any additional liquids consumed with medications and oral supplements.
4. If the resident’s food intake is less than 50% for three consecutive days, and it is not a noted change from the resident’s usual intake, the nurse/designate must review the plan of care to ensure appropriate nutrition interventions are in place and are accepted by the resident. If not, the nurse/designate must initiate a Referral – Registered Dietitian.

7. If the resident’s liquid intake does not meet their recommended fluid goal for three consecutive days, the nurse/designate must complete a Nutrition – Hydration Assessment – Nursing tool. If the resident is deemed to be showing signs and symptoms of dehydration according to the assessment, a Referral – Registered Dietitian (RD) tool must be initiated.
