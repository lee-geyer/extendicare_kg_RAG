# Overview

## BACKGROUND
This standard sets out the requirements for documentation and management for all models of health care records within all Extendicare owned and managed homes. Health care records promote resident safety, continuity of care across time and care settings, and support the transfer of information when the care of a resident is transferred, i.e., at clinical handover, during escalation of care for a deteriorating condition, and transfer of a resident between settings.

## KEY DEFINITIONS

### ATTENDING MEDICAL PRACTITIONER
Physician or Dentist responsible for the clinical care of the resident for that episode of care.

### APPROVED CLINICIAN
A clinician, other than a medical practitioner, approved to order tests, i.e., Nurse Practitioner.

### HEALTH CARE PERSONNEL
A person authorized to provide assessment, diagnosis, treatment/care, observation, health evaluation, or professional advice or those personnel who have access to the residents' health care records on behalf of the home to facilitate resident care. Health care personnel include clinicians (and students) and clinical support staff. Clinicians include registered health practitioners and others including registered practical and licensed practical nurses, social workers, registered dieticians, occupational therapists, and physiotherapists. Clinical support staff include office managers, unit clerks, health care interpreters, and accredited chaplains.

### HEALTH RECORD
The main purpose of a health care record is to provide a means of communication to facilitate the safe care and treatment of a resident. A health care record is the primary repository of information including medical and therapeutic treatment and intervention for the health and well-being of the resident during an episode of care and informs care in future episodes. The health care record is a documented account of a resident's history of illness; health care plan(s); health investigation and evaluation; diagnosis; care; treatment; progress; and health outcome for each health service intervention or interaction.

The health care record may also be used for communication with external health care providers, and statutory and regulatory bodies, in addition to facilitating resident safety improvements; investigation of complaints; planning; audit activities; research (subject to ethics committee approval, as required); education; financial reimbursement; and public health. The record may become an important piece of evidence in protecting the legal interests of the resident and health care personnel.

# EDUCATION

Homes must establish a framework for the development and delivery of suitable education on documentation and management of health care records. All health care personnel who document or manage health care records must be provided with appropriate orientation and ongoing education on the documentation and management of health care records. The content and delivery of education programs should be informed by health care record audits. The results of such audits should be used to target problem areas relating to particular health care personnel groups or facets of documentation and management. Specific education must be conducted for the introduction of any new complex health care record forms and for changes in documentation models.

## Documentation

### IDENTIFICATION ON EVERY PAGE/SCREEN

The following items must appear on every page of the health care record, or on each screen of an electronic record, with the exception of pop-up screens where the identifying details remain visible behind:

1. Unique identifier i.e., Unique Resident Identifier, Medical Record Number
2. Resident's family name and given name(s)
3. Date of birth
4. Sex

### STANDARDS FOR DOCUMENTATION

Documentation in health care records must comply with the following:

1. Be clear and accurate.
2. Legible and in French or English.
3. Use only approved abbreviations and symbols.
4. Written in dark ink that is readily reproducible, legible, and difficult to erase and write over for paper-based records.
5. Time of entry (using a 24-hour clock – hh:mm).
6. Date of entry (using dd/mm/yy or dd/mm/yyyy).
7. Signed by the author and include their printed name and designation. In a computerized system, this will require the use of an appropriate identification system i.e., electronic signature.

# Documentation Standards for Health Care Providers

## 8. Entries by Students
- Entries by students involved in the care and treatment of a resident must be co-signed by the student's supervising clinician.

## 9. Integration of Entries
- Entries by different professional groups are integrated; there are not separate sections for each professional group.

## 10. Accuracy in Clinical Interactions
- Be accurate with statements of clinical interactions between the resident and their significant others, and the health service relating to:
- Assessment
- Diagnosis
- Care planning
- Management/care/treatment/services provided and response/outcomes
- Professional advice sought and provided
- Observation(s) taken and results

## 11. Clarity and Structure
- Be sufficiently clear, structured, and detailed to enable other members of the health care team to assume care of the resident or to provide ongoing service at any time.

## 12. Objectivity
- Written in an objective way and not include demeaning or derogatory remarks.

## 13. Distinction of Observations
- Distinguish between what was observed or performed, what was reported by others as happening, and/or professional opinion.

## 14. Timeliness of Entries
- Made at the time of an event or as soon as possible afterwards. The time of writing must be distinguished from the time of an incident, event, or observation being reported.

## 15. Sequential Entries
- Sequential – where lines are left between entries, they must be ruled across to indicate they are not left for later entries and to reflect the sequential and contemporaneous nature of all entries.

## 16. Relevance
- Be relevant to that resident.

## 17. Personal Information
- Only include personal information about other people when relevant and necessary for the care and treatment of the resident.

## 18. Late Entry
- If an entry omits details, any additional details must be documented next to the heading 'Late Entry', including the date and time of the omitted event and the date and time of the late entry.

## 19. Integration of Late Entries
- For hardcopy records, late entries must be appropriately integrated within the record and not documented on additional papers and/or attached to existing forms.

## 20. Correction of Errors
- Written in error – all errors must be appropriately corrected.

## 21. Readability of Incorrect Entries
- An original incorrect entry must remain readable; do not overwrite incorrect entries, do not use correction fluid. An accepted method of correction is to draw a line through the incorrect entry or 'strikethrough' text in electronic records; document "written in error", followed by the author's printed name, signature, designation, and date/time of correction.

## 22. Electronic Records
- For electronic records, the history of audited changes must be retained, and the replacement note linked to the note flagged as "written in error". This provides the viewer with both the erroneous record and the corrected record.

# Documentation by Medical Practitioners
Documentation by medical practitioners must include the following:
1. Medical history
2. Evidence of physical examination

# Documentation Guidelines

## Diagnosis and Treatment
1. Diagnosis/es (as a minimum a provisional diagnosis), investigations, treatment, procedures/interventions, and progress for each treatment episode.
2. Comprehensive completion of all resident care forms.
3. A copy of letters or consultation notes provided to residents and/or their SDM must be retained in the resident's health care record.

## Attending Medical Practitioner
The Attending Medical Practitioner (AMP) is responsible for the clinical care of the resident for that episode of care and is responsible for ensuring that adequate standards of medical documentation are maintained for each resident under their care.

- When documentation is delegated to a medical practitioner, e.g., intern, resident, registrar, the AMP remains responsible for ensuring documentation is completed to an appropriate standard that would satisfy their professional obligations.
- The AMP should review the preceding medical entries and make a written entry in the health care record (print name, signature, designation, and date/time) to confirm they have been read at the same time as they are reviewing the medical management plan for the resident to ensure it remains current and clinically appropriate, consistent with the AMP's duty of care to the resident.

## Documentation by the Interdisciplinary Team
Documentation by the interdisciplinary team must include the following:
1. Care/treatment plan, including risk assessments with associated interventions.
2. Comprehensive completion of all resident care forms.
3. Any significant change in the resident's status with the onset of new signs and symptoms recorded.
4. If a change in the resident's status has been reported to the responsible medical practitioner, documentation of the name of the medical practitioner and the date and time that the change was reported to him/her.
5. Documentation of medication orders received verbally, by telephone/electronic communication including the prescriber's name, designation, and date/time.

## Frequency of Documentation
The frequency of documentation entries should conform to the following as minimum requirements.

### Long Stay Residents
Extendicare Canada Inc. supports best practice related to documentation and as such, charting by exception is the accepted practice in our homes. This means that...

# Documentation Standards for Resident Care

## Regular Routine Care
Regular, routine care would be documented on daily flow sheets (or electronic equivalent) and entries are only required in the progress notes to document changes in the resident's condition, or any other pertinent information that would be outside of the resident's normal daily routine.

In addition, all assessments must be recorded in the health care record as well as communication to the resident and/or the resident's family/SDM related to the resident's care must also be documented. Visits from consulting specialists or an allied health professional would mandate a notation regarding the treatment provided and the response to treatment along with the health professional’s name, title, and date.

Additional entries should be made to reflect changes in the resident status, condition and/or treatment or care plan as these occur. Documentation of leaves from the home and returns from leaves must also be documented.

## Short Stay/Respite Care Residents
The same documentation practices and standards apply to short stay residents with the exception of assessments that are scheduled beyond the length of the resident's stay (i.e., assessments that are normally completed 14 days post-admission for a resident who is admitted for only 10 days would not be completed).

## Alerts and Allergies
Clinicians must flag issues that require particular attention or pose a threat to the resident, staff, or others including:

1. Allergies/sensitivities or adverse reactions, and the known consequence.
2. Infection prevention and control risks.
3. Behaviour issues that may pose a risk to themselves or others.
4. Resident protection/well-being matters including:
- Alerts and flags for individuals who have harmed the resident in the past or have had a restraining order placed against them preventing them from having contact with the resident.
- Where police have issued a general alert to a home regarding a particular individual.
5. Where residents have similar names and other demographic details.

Homes must implement systems for the identification of such alerts and allergies. If a label is used on the outside spine of a paper-based health care record, this does not negate the need for documentation in the health care record of the alert/allergy and known consequence.

Any such issue should be 'flagged' or recorded conspicuously on appropriate forms, screens, or locations within the health care record. Where alerts relate to behaviour issues or resident protection matters, the alert should be discreet to ensure the privacy and safety of the resident, staff, or others.

These flags, especially where codes or abbreviations are used, must be apparent to and...

# Document Title

## Metadata
- **Policy Number:** [Insert Policy Number]
- **Effective Date:** [Insert Effective Date]
- **Review Date:** [Insert Review Date]

## Labels
Non-permanent adhesive labels should be avoided. Where considered essential, the label must be relevant to the resident and placed so that all parts of the health care record are able to be read and resident privacy maintained. Only approved labels may be used.

## Tests – Requests and Results
The health care record must document all laboratory, radiology, and other tests ordered, the indication, and the result. When tests are ordered, the name of the ordering medical practitioner/approved clinician, and their contact number must be clearly printed (if written) or entered (if computerized) on the request form.

Pathology, radiology, and other test results must be followed up and reviewed with notation as to action required. The results must be endorsed by the receiving medical practitioner/approved clinician, with endorsement involving the name, signature, designation of the medical practitioner/approved clinician, and date/time.

Homes must develop local procedures, including steps to be taken, when:
1. Relevant details on the request form are incomplete or illegible.
2. The ordering medical practitioner/approved clinician is not on duty or contactable.

Critical/unexpected/abnormal results should be documented in the resident's health care record by the responsible medical practitioner/approved clinician as soon as practicable, and any resultant change in care/treatment plans documented.

## Resident Clinical Incidents
All actual clinical incidents must be documented in the resident's health care record. The interdisciplinary team must document in the health care record:
1. Clinically relevant information about the incident.
2. Interactions related to open disclosure processes.

## Complaints
Complaint records are not to be kept with the resident's health care record. Complaints are to be submitted to the Executive Director/Administrator for follow-up and corrective action. A copy of all complaints received is to be maintained by the Executive Director/Administrator, as well as a log of all complaints received, and corrective actions taken.

# TELEPHONE/ELECTRONIC CONSULTATION WITH RESIDENTS

When clinical information is provided to a resident, or their family / SDM, the consultation must be documented in the health care record. The identification of the caller must be documented.

Where the caller is not the resident, or their family/SDM, obtain consent from the resident, or their SDM prior to the consultation. Document:

1. Caller's name,
2. Relationship to the resident, and
3. That the resident, or their SDM has consented to the caller seeking clinical information about the resident in the resident's health care record.

# TELEPHONE/ELECTRONIC CONSULTATION BETWEEN CLINICIANS

Where a clinician involved in the care and treatment of a resident formally consults another clinician, via telephone/electronic means, about the resident and the consulted clinician provides advice, direction, or action, that advice, direction, or action must be documented in the health care record by the clinician seeking the advice. The name and designation of the consulted clinician, and the date/time of the consultation must also be documented as soon as practical following consultation with the other clinician and in a manner as to ensure continuity of care for residents.

# LEAVE TAKEN BY RESIDENTS

Any leave taken by the resident should be documented in their health care record with the date/time the resident left and returned. The resident should be assessed before proceeding on leave and the outcome of that assessment documented in the health care record, and a head to toe assessment must also be completed for all leaves exceeding 24 hours. Refer to the Skin and Wound Program: Prevention of Skin Breakdown to access the Head to Toe Assessment.

# LEAVING AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE

A competent resident who decides to leave the home against medical advice must be asked to sign a form to that effect with the form filed in the resident's health care record. If the resident refuses to sign the form, this must be documented in the health care record, including any advice provided.

Examples of advice that could be provided to the resident include:

1. The potential consequences of the resident's decision to leave the home.
2. The provision or offering of alternative living arrangements/plan and follow-up that is acceptable and relevant to the resident.
3. Information about community support and a referral to any community support agencies that could provide the resident with the appropriate housing, care, and treatment.

# Management

## RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY
The Executive Director/Administrator must comply with this policy and all applicable privacy and personal health information legislation and regulations in effect in the province in which the home is located as they relate to the management of health care records. Responsibility for the maintenance of appropriate health care records must be included in the terms and conditions of employment (including position descriptions) for all health care personnel as defined in this policy. Documentation must be included as a standing item in annual performance reviews of clinicians. Failure to maintain adequate health care records will be managed in accordance with current policies and guidelines for managing potential misconduct, up to and including termination of employment.

## INDIVIDUAL HEALTH CARE RECORD
An individual health care record with a unique identifier (i.e., unique resident identifier) must be created for each resident who is admitted.

## ACCESS
Health care records should be available at the point of care or service delivery. Health care records must not be removed from the home unless prior arrangements have been made with the Executive Director (ED)/Administrator (i.e., required under subpoena).

Health care records are only accessible to:
1. Health care personnel currently providing care/treatment to the resident.
2. Staff involved in resident safety, the investigation of complaints, audit activities or research (subject to ethics committee approval, as required).
3. Staff involved in urgent public health investigations for protecting public/population health, consistent with relevant legislation.
4. Resident to whom the record relates, or their authorized agent, based on a case by case basis in accordance with Extendicare Canada Inc.’s release of information policy and privacy laws.
5. Other personnel/organizations/individuals in accordance with a court subpoena, statutory authority, valid search warrant, summons, or other lawful order authorized by legislation, or Canadian common law.

All requests for information that is contained in a resident's health care record from a third/external party should be handled by the ED/Administrator or Regional Director due to the sensitive nature of health care records, the special terminology used within them, and regulatory requirements around access to and disclosure of information.

## OWNERSHIP
The health care record is the property of the home providing care, and not individual health care personnel.

# Health Care Records Management Policy

## Retention and Durability

- Health care records must be maintained in a retrievable and readable state for a period of **10 years**.
- Records involved in a court case or investigation must be kept for **20 years** past the date that the investigation was concluded, or the court case closed.
- Entries should not fade, be erased, or deleted over time. The use of thermal papers, which fade over time, should be restricted to those clinical documents where no other suitable paper or electronic medium is available (e.g., electrocardiographs, cardiotocographs).
- Electronic records must be:
- Accessible over time, regardless of software or hardware changes.
- Capable of being reproduced on paper where appropriate.
- Regularly backed up.

## Storage and Security

- Personal health information, including healthcare records, must have appropriate security safeguards in place to prevent unauthorized use, disclosure, loss, or other misuse. For example:
- All records containing personal health information should be kept in lockable storage or secure access areas when not in use.
- Control over the movement of paper-based health care records is important. A tracking system is required to facilitate prompt retrieval to support resident care and treatment and to preserve privacy.
- A secure physical and electronic environment should be maintained for all data held on computer systems by the use of:
- Authorized passwords
- Screen savers
- Audit trails
- If left unattended, no personal health information should be left on the screen. Screen savers and passwords will be used to reduce the chance of casual observation.
- Consideration may be given to providing staff with different levels of access to electronic records where appropriate (e.g., full, partial, or no access).

## Document Destruction and Disposal

- Health care records, both paper-based and electronic, must be disposed of in a manner that will preserve the privacy and confidentiality of any information they contain.
- Disposal of data records should be done in such a way as to render them unreadable and leave them in a form from which they cannot be reconstructed in whole or in part.
- Paper records containing personal health information should be disposed of by:
- Shredding
- Pulping
- Burning
- Where large volumes of paper are involved, specialized services for the safe disposal of confidential material should be employed.
- The disposal of health care records must be documented in the **Document Destruction Log** and kept on file in the **Executive Director/Administrator's office**.
