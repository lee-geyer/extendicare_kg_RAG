| Date Initiated | Date Completed |
|----------------|----------------|

1. Review laboratory procedures and ensure appropriate laboratory supplies are available (and not expired) in sufficient quantities (order Nasopharyngeal swabs from PH lab if needed). Ensure access to test kits (respiratory/enteric).
2. Ensure written or verbal consents are obtained (influenza immunization/antiviral prophylactic medications) from all residents (consult with Pharmacy/Pharmacist ensure Tami Flu in ESB (Emergency Supply Box) is not expired).
3. Ensure creatinine data is current for each resident (review that labs are up to date with Pharmacist, consult with MD/NP for bloodwork orders for any outstanding).
4. Obtain and document current weights for each resident.
5. Review and complete monthly new admission audits to ensure relevant data has been obtained (consent, creatinine levels and weight).
6. Outline strategies for immunization campaign including:
- Presenting the importance of immunization to Family and Resident council
- Communicating to POA upcoming immunization campaigns
- Updating staff immunization lists for immunization
- Contacting Public Guardian & Trustee for all required residents
- Faxing consent forms, as required. Proceed with planning as follows:
a. Determine times and places for immunization clinics (include day and evening clinics)
b. Distribute Public Health or Extendicare-developed resources and information about the vaccine and benefits of immunization by posting these throughout the home in high traffic areas i.e., elevators, entrances and in home areas.
c. Organize education day for staff (pending resource availability from Public Health).
d. Start organizing a “fun activity” to occur during the campaign.
e. Distribute Staff Influenza Intention forms to all staff and update staff immunization lists, as applicable.
f. Update resident immunization consent in PCC under the resident immunization tab.
g. Ensure a contingency plan is in place to reflect strategies for non-immunized staff (e.g., Tami Flu, not able to come to work, limited to work in certain areas).
7. Assemble, audit, and inventory other material and supplies (e.g., personal protective equipment).
