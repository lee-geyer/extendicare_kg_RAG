## POLICY

### Nutritional Care and Hydration

----

## PROCEDURE

Residents’ weights are monitored and any weight change impacting the residents’ health status is addressed using an interdisciplinary team approach.

### Upon Move-in
- The nurse/designate will measure and document the resident’s height and weight within one week of move-in (height annually, thereafter).
- The Registered Dietitian (RD) will calculate and document the Body Mass Index (BMI) (minimum annually, thereafter).
- The RD will determine and record the resident’s goal weight range (GWR) within the resident’s plan of care. The GWR will be reassessed as required.

### Monthly
- A designated nursing individual in each home will be responsible for ensuring weights (and reweighs as required) are completed and documented by the 7th day of each month.
- If a weight loss or gain of 2.0 kg or greater is identified as compared to the preceding month, the resident will be weighed again to confirm the variance.
- The RD/designate will review weight documentation monthly to ensure all significant weight changes have been addressed and any plan of care revisions completed, if required.

### Other
- A resident will be weighed following return from an extended leave of absence where the monthly weight was not obtained.
- A resident receiving end of life care may not be weighed to maintain comfort.
- A resident who is deemed palliative and not getting out of bed or cannot be weighed comfortably using a lift scale does not need to be weighed. A visual assessment can be substituted when completing nutrition assessment/review.
- A resident may be weighed for any significant change in condition in correlation to a required InterRAI assessment, as necessary.

- An interdisciplinary approach will determine the possible factors contributing to the weight variance.

- The RD will reassess the resident’s nutritional requirements and current intake, as well as other possible reasons for weight variance.

- In collaboration with the resident and/or substitute decision maker (SDM)/Power of Attorney (POA) and other members of the interdisciplinary team, the RD initiates interventions to minimize further undesirable weight changes.

- The RD will document in the resident’s medical record and applicable interventions added to the resident’s plan of care.

- The Culinary Manager or designate will update the resident’s Nutrition Profile in the food service software to reflect current interdisciplinary interventions.
