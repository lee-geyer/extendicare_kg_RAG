It is a common cause of vomiting and diarrhea each winter and is often referred to as 'winter vomiting disease' or 'stomach flu' (although it is not caused by the influenza virus). Norovirus infections have been linked to outbreaks of vomiting and/or diarrhea in child-care centres, long-term care homes as well as on cruise ships, camps, schools, restaurants, households and other places where people gather.## How does the Norovirus spread? Norovirus is found in the stool and sometimes in the vomit of ill persons. People can become infected with the virus in several ways:\n- Direct contact (e.g. shaking hands) with another person who is infected. - Touching surfaces or objects contaminated with the virus (e.g. doorknob, hand or stair railings, etc.) and then touching your mouth or eyes. - Eating food or drinking beverages that are contaminated by an infected person. - Eating food such as shellfish contaminated at the source.Airborne transmission has been suggested to explain its rapid spread in settings like schools and day cares.",

Those infected with Norovirus can spread it once they feel ill and for up to two days after the symptoms (usually diarrhea) stop, but people can carry the virus for up to two weeks longer.## What are the signs and symptoms of Norovirus infection? Infected individuals usually experience sudden onset of nausea, vomiting and watery diarrhea that lasts about one to three days. Other symptoms may include fever and stomach cramps. Severe illness or hospitalization is uncommon. Dehydration is the most common complication, especially among young children and the elderly. Seek medical attention if you have high fever, bloody diarrhea or illness lasting longer than 72 hours.## How long do symptoms of Norovirus infection last? Infected individuals usually recover in two to three days without serious or long-term health effects.## How soon do the symptoms appear after I have been exposed?",

Symptoms usually appear within 10 hours, but can develop up to two days after exposure to the virus.## How is Norovirus infection diagnosed? Doctors generally diagnose Norovirus infection based on symptoms including the sudden onset, the short duration (usually one to three days) and the quick resolution of the infection. However, a stool sample may be collected by your doctor in certain circumstances.## Is Norovirus infection the same as the \"flu\"? People sometimes call Norovirus infection the \"stomach flu\".

Getting the influenza vaccine each fall/winter (it is free for anyone who works, attends school or lives in Ontario), while important for protection against the flu, will not protect you against Norovirus infection.**SOURCE:** Toronto Public Health Unit# How can I reduce my risk of Norovirus infection?- **Keep your hands clean.** Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 15 seconds after using the toilet, diapering a child, and before preparing or eating food. This is the best way of reducing the risk of getting infected with Norovirus. - If soap and water are not available, and if hands are not visibly soiled, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with 70% - 90% alcohol. - **Do not prepare food for others** if you have symptoms of vomiting or diarrhea. - **Clean and disinfect high touch surfaces**, at minimum, twice daily with an approved disinfectant. Shared equipment should be cleaned and disinfected after each resident use.",
