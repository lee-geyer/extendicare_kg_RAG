      "text": "# Extendicare\n\n## Barbicide Fact SheetBarbicide is a clear blue solution often used to disinfect hairdressing and barbering equipment such as combs, brushes, and scissors. Health Canada categorizes a quaternary ammonium product as a low-level disinfectant.### Proper uses of Barbicide:1. **Clean tools before using Barbicide:**\n- A dirty tool cannot be properly disinfected. Placing a soiled item (e.g., comb with hair strands) in a container filled with Barbicide will not disinfect the item; it will only contaminate the solution, and all other items placed in it. - All tools must be thoroughly cleaned with soap/detergent, scrubbed with a brush, then rinsed with potable water before placing them in the Barbicide solution.2. **Put Barbicide by the sink:**\n- Put the Barbicide container next to the sink rather than the workstation. This will make it easier to wash items first before disinfecting with Barbicide.3. **Follow instructions:**\n- Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions about:\n- Proper dilution. - How often it needs to be changed. - The amount of time the disinfectant must remain wet on the surface of the instrument.4.",
