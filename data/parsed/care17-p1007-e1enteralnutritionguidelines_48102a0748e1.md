# GUIDELINES FOR ADMISSION OF RESIDENT ON ENTERAL FEED

**IMPORTANT:** Best practice supports the use of closed system enteral feeding. Homes are encouraged to adopt this practice in all instances where enteral feeding is required. Closed systems reduce handling/risk of contamination, allow longer hang times, and reduce the frequency of bag changes.

## 1. Notification and Initial Contact
When the Director of Care/designate is notified concerning admission of a resident who is receiving enteral nutrition, the Director of Care/designate must contact the hospital/appropriate Registered Dietitian (RD) to inquire about the formula type and total volume of feeding, method of delivery, rate and times of delivery, type of feeding catheter.

## 2. Communication with Registered Dietitian
The Director of Care/designate must contact the Registered Dietitian (RD) and inform them of admission, diet/tube feed orders including:
- Formula type
- Total volume
- Method of delivery
- Rate
- Water/fluid requirements
- Times/duration of feeds
- Expected date and time of admission

## 3. Routine Assessment Upon Admission
Upon admission, routine assessment should include:
- a. Current formula used, rate, and any recent adjustments.
- b. Amount and timing of water flushes.
- c. Measurement of feeding catheter from stoma to tip.
- d. Type and French size of feeding catheter.
- e. Feeding pump manufacturer and model.
- f. Past problems with intolerances to any formula.
- g. Weight, rate of weight gain or loss on current energy level.
- h. Recent laboratory results and trends in labs (electrolytes, Hemoglobin/Hematocrit, albumin, fasting blood glucose (FBG) and HbA1C if diabetic, and any other pertinent labs).

## 4. Review and Confirmation of Orders
The RD must review the orders received from the hospital, and RD/physician must write/confirm orders on the Physicians’ Order Sheet for:
- Type of formula
- Total volume
- Rate of formula
- Total water
- Rate of water and flushes
- Any other nutrients

## 5. Supply Management
The Director of Care/designate must ensure there is adequate supply of the specified formula, feeding pumps and tubing, and any other supplies and equipment in the facility prior to admission of the resident.

----

**Page 3 of 13**

# GUIDELINES FOR EQUIPMENT AND FORMULA

## Pumps and Feeding Sets
- Dual flow feeding pumps are preferred to manage administration of both formula and water flushes. Other types of pumps and administration sets are also available. Please contact vendor representatives, Silver Group Purchasing Network (SGP) and/or manufacturer websites for more information.

## Syringes
- Two Syringes must be designated for use: One for medication and one for water flushing.
- Syringes must be changed at a minimum weekly or as required (soiled, ease of use reduced) per clinical assessment.
- Syringes must be washed with warm soapy water and rinsed after use, dried in a clean space and stored in a clean container.

## What is ENfit?
- ENFit is the new International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard for connecting nutritional delivery systems such as feeding sets and feeding tubes.
- Every extension set, syringe and feeding tube must be designed with a specific ENFit connector so that only products designed for enteral/tube feeding access can be connected.
- Button-style gastrostomy tubes (G-tubes) will not change – only the extension sets that connect to them will change.
- Most tubing sets, bags and ready-to-hang formulas on the market are ENfit-ready. However, a resident’s feeding catheter/tube may not be ENfit-ready and there are still older connections available for purchase. In these situations, ENFit adaptors are to be used to ensure compatibility across products and supplies.

## Gastrostomy/Gastro-Jejunal Feeding Tubes
- Replacement tubes come in a variety of types and sizes and are expensive. The Executive Director/Administrator, along with the Medical Director and Director of Care, must determine whether there is a need to stock replacement tubes within the home. In most instances, it should be adequate to order the tube from a supplier when needed or be dependent upon the local hospital for replacement with their preferred product.

### Two types of replacement tubes are available:
- Replacement tubes held in place with a water inflated balloon.
- Buttons; preferable as a replacement for a Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG) tube because the device lies flush with abdominal skin and is more difficult for a resident to remove.

## Enteral Formula
- Ready-to-hang (closed system) products are recommended. Some formulas are available in smaller containers for use with an open system, which should only be used if there is not a closed system alternative.
- For further information on available products, please contact the vendor representative, SGP and/or manufacturer websites.

# GUIDELINES FOR METHODS OF DELIVERY

## Bolus Feeding
- 200 - 400 milliliters delivered over a period of 5-15 minutes, given four to six times/day.
- Rates of <60 ml/minute are better tolerated; often start with 60-120 ml every four hours, increase by 30-60 ml every eight to twelve hours.
- The maximum generally tolerated volume is 720 ml every four to six hours.
- This method is not recommended for Long Term Care.

## Intermittent Feeds
- Formula given over 30-90 minutes, four to six times per day.

## Continuous Feeds
- Formula given at a set rate over 16-24 hours.

**Note:** Diarrhea may be more likely with intermittent feedings. Clogged tubes may be more likely with continuous feeding. Studies have shown that continuous feeding resulted in improved glucose control and decreased insulin requirements, compared to intermittent feedings.

## Initiating Tube Feeding
- Feeding can usually be initiated at full strength at 10-40 ml/hour.
- Some experts recommend starting at half-strength if a resident has not eaten for five days, or if a hyperosmolar feeding is used.
- Slow progression to goal can be achieved by increasing the rate by 20-50 ml/hour every four to six hours, while monitoring for signs of intolerance.
- A slower progression of feeding is recommended for residents at higher risk of refeeding syndrome or with use of high calorie or high osmolality formulas.

## Progression from Continuous to Intermittent Feedings
- Intermittent feedings are often preferred to increase the resident’s quality of life by allowing them to be disconnected and participate in home activities.
- Progress by increasing the rate by 30-50 ml/hour, while decreasing the hours of infusion.
- Progression from continuous to intermittent feedings should only be attempted when the enteral feeding is well established, with no signs of intolerance, and the resident is expected to be able to tolerate the increased volume.

## Transition from Enteral to Oral Intake
- Discontinue daytime tube feeding and change to nighttime tube feedings only when resident is meeting a third to half of their nutrient needs orally or ingesting 500-700 Calories (kcal)/day
- **OR**
- Hold enteral feeding for one hour pre- and post- oral feeding; discontinue enteral nutrition when 75% of nutrition needs are met by oral intake for a period of three days.
- During this process, the RD may request detailed records of the resident’s intake to be maintained.
- Frequent adjustments to the volume, rate, and delivery time may be required.
- The Interdisciplinary Team will work closely to ensure nutritional status and hydration are not compromised.

# GUIDELINES FOR ADMINISTRATION

1. Gather supplies. Formulas must be at room temperature prior to feeding.
2. If an Open System is being used, ensure the top of the container is clean, shake well before opening. Formula left in the original container must be labelled with date and time opened and refrigerated. Label container bag with resident name, formula name, date/time.
3. Wash hands.
4. Explain procedure to resident.
5. Check tube placement before each intermittent or bolus feeding. For continuous feeding, check once per day.
6. Check for bowel sounds, nausea, emesis, or abdominal distension.
7. Notify the MD/NP if there are concerns that tube is displaced or signs/symptoms of intolerance.
8. Follow manufacturer's instructions for operating the pump, cleaning, and care of the equipment (Pump and pole). Ensure pump is functioning properly and programmed correctly (feed rate, water rate, flushes, and total volumes).
9. Ensure spike sets are changed according to manufacturer’s directions. Most closed system tubing sets will be changed when the formula bag is changed.
10. Ensure the head of the bed is elevated 30-45 degrees or resident is seated in a chair to reduce risk of aspiration, promote gastric emptying, and resident comfort during feeding.
11. The resident must remain upright for 30-60 minutes following the feeding.

# GUIDELINES FOR ADMINISTERING MEDICATIONS VIA ENTERAL TUBE

## Recommended Practice or Technique

| Recommended Practice                                   | Rationale                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Flush catheter with 15-30 ml water before administering medication. | Clear catheter lumen of inadequately crushed medication residue.                             |
| Flush with 30-60 ml water after administering medication. *** | Evaluate patency of the catheter. Prevent drug-drug and drug-formula incompatibilities.     |
| Do not crush enteric-coated or sustained-release medications. | Avoid potential adverse effects associated with higher expected peak concentrations followed by sub-therapeutic concentrations. |
| Use alternative drug formulations or therapeutically similar drug i.e. elixir. | Enteric-coated: avoid stomach irritation or destruction of drug by gastric acids.            |
| Dilute highly viscous and hyperosmolar liquid medications with 10-30 ml water before administration. | Prevent obstruction by viscous solutions. Prevent physiological incompatibilities (e.g., irritation to the gastric mucosa, gastric distention, diarrhea). |
| Do not add medications to the feeding formula.       | Prevent physical and pharmacokinetic incompatibilities (e.g., change in drug potency and bioavailability). Avoid formula contamination. Ensure receipt of entire dose. |
| Crush pills into a fine powder. Mix with approximately 15 ml water. Administer each medication separately. Flush with 15 ml water between medications. Rinse syringe between medications. | Prevent pharmacokinetic incompatibilities (drug-drug interactions). Reduce risk of occlusion. |
| Consult with Pharmacist regarding availability of liquid dosage forms, alternative dosage equivalents, and drug-nutrient compatibilities. | Avoid or manage problems: obstruction, incompatibilities, and gastrointestinal intolerance. Determine alternative therapies or formulations. |

*** Amount of water for flushing may be modified if a fluid restriction is required.

# Medication Considerations with Enteral Feeding

1. If possible and medically feasible, medications should be administered by a route other than the feeding tube. If not, follow guidelines for administering medications via enteral tube.
2. Medication orders must specify the correct route for the resident (oral or via enteral tube).
3. Where possible, liquid medication may be preferable; a comprehensive medication review should be conducted. Keep in mind that some liquid medications may have very high osmolality which may not be tolerated even when diluted.
4. The absorption of some medications is affected by enteral formulas. The Pharmacist and RD must be consulted to recalculate the continuous feed to accommodate hold times for the following medications:
- a. Antibiotics – Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin)
- b. Antibacterials (Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Tetracycline, Trimethoprim)
- c. Warfarin (Coumadin)
- d. Phenytoin (Dilantin)
- e. Carbamazepine (Tegretol)
- f. Anti-Retrovirals (Dolutegravir, Tenofovir, Elvitegravir, Emtricitabine, Raltegravir)
- g. Immunosuppressants (Tacrolimus, Azathioprine)
- h. Bisphosphonates (Risendronate, Alendronic acid)
- i. Levothyroxine
- j. Antifungals (Itraconazole, Voriconazole)

## Drugs Not Compatible with Enteral Feeding

- Many drugs combined with enteral products cause thickening or clumping by visual inspection. This may clog the feeding tube. Delivery method, tube diameter, formula composition, tube placement, and flushing protocol also influence compatibility. Many drugs have not been tested.
- Consult with the Pharmacist regarding medications that are prescribed via enteral feeding.

# Criteria to be Considered for Optimal Tolerance and Safety with Enteral Nutrition

## Temperature of Formula
- Continuous, intermittent and bolus feeds must be administered at room temperature to decrease GI side effects such as cramping.

## Bacterial Contamination
- Clean handling techniques must always be used as per IPAC and manufacturer’s protocols for infection control. A clean working surface must be prepared.
- Cleaned syringes must be stored in a clean container.
- Ready-to-feed closed systems reduce the risk of contamination.
- Closed system tubing sets must be changed each time the formula container is changed or more frequently if required. Hang times for closed systems vary between 24-48 hours. Always follow manufacturer’s instructions.

## Aspiration
Risk factors for aspiration include:
- Sedation
- Supine feeding position
- Malposition or migration of the feeding tube
- Mechanical ventilation
- Vomiting
- Bolus feeding
- Presence of high-risk disease or injury
- Poor oral health
- Advanced age

To reduce risk of aspiration:
- Head of bed must be elevated to 30-45° during the administration of the feeding and for 30-60 minutes post feeding. If this position is contraindicated, consider the reverse Trendelenburg position (i.e., blocks under the head of bed).
- Verify tube position before initiating feedings (see patency).
- Gastric residual volume (GRV) measurement has not been shown to be a reliable marker for risk of aspiration/aspiration pneumonia. If measured, GRV should be utilized in conjunction with other signs of intolerance.
- Deliver enteral nutrition continuously rather than intermittently to residents with intolerance to gastric bolus feedings.
- Monitor for signs/symptoms of emesis or reflux.
- Consider a course of promotility agents where clinically feasible in residents with high risk of aspiration.

## Patency
- Feeding tubes must be flushed every four hours with 20-60 ml water for continuous feeds; for intermittent and bolus feeds before and after each administration.
- **Migration**: Mark the catheter where it leaves the stoma with a marker. Measure the distance from the mark to the end of the tubing/joint of the port and record this measurement weekly to monitor catheter migration. Report to Physician (MD)/Nurse Practitioner (NP) if tube is moving.
- **Verify tube length**:
- When beginning/ending feeding, always observe the marked position. Report to MD/NP if tube is moving (Catheters may migrate inwards OR outwards).
- Bouts of coughing, problems catching breath, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or tube feeding formula in the saliva may indicate a displaced tube. Report to MD/NP immediately.
- Physical evidence of possible displacement such as loose tape, visibly tube appears longer.
- Resident may require x-ray verification if dislodgement is suspected.

For clogged tubes, flush with 30-60 ml warm water using a 60 ml syringe using a gentle forward/back motion (if resident has NO fluid restriction).

----

**Page 10 of 13**

# Obstructed Tube

- Residents with enteral feeds should have an order for pancreatic enzyme and sodium bicarbonate tablets in case of obstruction.
- Attempt to withdraw as much formula as possible from the tube and discard.
- Attempt to irrigate feeding tube with lukewarm water using a 20ml syringe and gentle pressure. If resistance is encountered, stop.
- If tube remains clogged, mix:
- 1 crushed pancreatic enzyme tablet
- 1 crushed (324 grams) sodium bicarbonate tablet
- with 5-15ml lukewarm water.
- Inject the enzyme solution into the clogged enteral feeding tube port using gentle pressure.
- Allow to sit for 15-30 minutes.
- Re-irrigate feeding tube with 20-30 ml water using gentle pressure.
- This process may be repeated up to three times. If after three attempts, the procedure is not successful in unclogging the feeding tube, contact the MD/NP for further instructions.
- Do NOT use fruit juice or carbonated beverages as this can precipitate further coagulation.

## Inadvertent G/PEG Removal

- If a feeding tube comes out (resident removes, falls out, balloon collapses etc.), do not panic! Contact MD/NP stat.
- A mature tract will allow for introduction of a new tube without difficulty within 24 hours and may be replaced by the MD/NP should they choose to do so. The MD/NP may instruct the nurse to insert a foley catheter to prevent closure of the stoma and tract.
- Tracts in place for less than two weeks may not be fully established and will require re-insertion at the hospital (will require endoscopy).

## Feeding Tube Replacement

- Replacement of the feeding tube will be directed by the MD/NP.
- If completed at the home, the appropriate feeding tube will be ordered if not in home.
- The registered staff will assemble required supplies to assist the MD/NP (sterile dressing, tray, replacement tube etc.).

**Page 11 of 13**

# GUIDELINES FOR DOCUMENTATION

## The Registered Nursing Staff must document:

1. Label formula bags when hung with resident name, date, and time spiked.
2. Actual amounts of formula and water infused (utilize the medication administration record for recording actual volumes fed). Document if volume ordered is not infused and why.
3. Any complications/intolerances associated with tube feeding i.e., diarrhea, constipation, nausea/vomiting, abdominal distention, cramping, signs/symptoms of dehydration, overhydration, glucose intolerance.
4. Any problems related to equipment (pump, tubing) and action taken.
5. Any difficulties related to administration of medications.
6. Any issues related to PEG site/stoma and action taken.
7. Weight loss/gain.
8. Oral intake, if applicable, will be recorded using designated tracking tools for food and fluid intake residuals monitoring and frequency, if ordered.
9. Lab values monitoring and frequency, as ordered.
10. Progress toward weaning from tube feeding if applicable.
11. Positioning.
12. Feeding tube site care, including measurement of tube extension, ostomy care, skin care.
13. Resident/family/staff education.
14. Oral care as per procedure.
15. Ensure medication orders specify the correct route for the Resident (oral or by EN).
