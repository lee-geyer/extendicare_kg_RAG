## Policy
Residents experiencing a low blood glucose level will be treated promptly to raise the blood glucose to a safe level (greater than or equal to 4 mmol/L). Each home will prepare and have available at each nurses station, a hypoglycemia treatment kit which may include: glucose in the form of glucose tablets or packet of table sugar, packet of honey or jam, and glucagon.

## Background
Hypoglycemia is defined as a blood glucose (BG) level less than 4.0 mmol/L with symptoms that include trembling, sweating, palpitations, nausea, hunger, confusion, drowsiness, weakness, difficulty speaking, and headache.

Hypoglycemia in an elderly person with diabetes can be a serious and underestimated clinical problem that has significant morbidity and mortality. Older persons with diabetes may have fewer symptoms of hypoglycemia or decreased awareness of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia in the elderly can be more severe and prolonged, and it can precipitate a cardiovascular event.

Hypoglycemia is caused by inadequate carbohydrate (CHO) intake at meals, increased physical activity, or excess oral anti-hyperglycemic agents/insulin. Glucose or dextrose tablets or sugar dissolved in water are the preferred choice for treatment because these are absorbed more quickly than orange juice or glucose gels. Glucose gels are generally not recommended because they must be swallowed to be effective and are slowly absorbed.

The elderly are frequently on multiple medications and may have kidney or liver impairment, which may lead to changes in the breakdown of medications. Therefore, it is important to prevent, recognize, and treat hypoglycemic episodes secondary to the use of diabetes medications promptly.

# Extendicare Diabetes Management: Hypoglycemia Procedures

## Director of Care / Designate

1. Ensure that staff are aware of the Diabetes Management program policies and maintain a fully stocked hypoglycemia treatment kit in an easily accessible location on each resident home area.
2. Evaluate the effectiveness of the Diabetes Management program within the home annually and as required and make changes as necessary to address any areas of improvement required.
3. Notify the applicable Quality, Risk and Innovation (QRI) consultant for the home of any recommendations for improvement of the Diabetes Management program, including those in accordance with evidence-based practice or prevailing practices.

### Ontario Only

1. Ensure all resident episodes of severe hypoglycemia, unresponsive hypoglycemia, and any administration of glucagon to a resident, are reported, investigated, and tracked. For incidents of severe hypoglycemia, unresponsive hypoglycemia, and any administration of glucagon to a resident that results in the resident being taken to a hospital, these will also need to be submitted as reports directly through the Critical Incident Reporting System under the following categories:
- Use of glucagon which results in the resident being taken to a hospital
- Severe hypoglycemia, unresponsive hypoglycemia which results in the resident being taken to a hospital
2. Ensure an interdisciplinary team, including the Medical Director, the Administrator, the Director of Care, and the pharmacy service provider, meet at a minimum of quarterly to evaluate and document:
a. The identification of any utilization trends and patterns related to:
i. The use of glucagon in the home
ii. Incidents of severe hypoglycemia
iii. Incidents of unresponsive hypoglycemia
b. Corrective actions to improve the use of glucagon in the home and treatment of hypoglycemia.
c. The progress on corrective actions identified from prior quarterly or annual meetings.
> **Note:** These items must be included in the annual review by the interdisciplinary team meeting.
3. Ensure an interdisciplinary team, including the Medical Director, the Administrator, the Director of Care, and the pharmacy service provider, meet to evaluate and document written records from the year's quarterly meetings including items from above.
4. Discuss and document an action plan during the annual interdisciplinary team meeting to identify any change necessary to improve the care and treatment of hypoglycemia and any outstanding corrective actions.

# Diabetes Management: Hypoglycemia Procedures

## NURSE

1. Monitor resident blood glucose levels as directed by the physician and/or
2. Treat all episodes of hypoglycemia (BG less than or equal to 3.9 mmol/L) immediately.

### TREATMENT OF CONSCIOUS RESIDENT WHO IS ABLE TO INGEST

1. Administer 15g carbohydrate (CHO). This may be in the form of glucose tablets or 3 packets of table sugar dissolved in water, or give ¾ cup juice or regular soft drink, or 1 portion pack of honey or jam.
2. Wait 15 minutes and retest the resident's blood glucose (BG) level. If BG is less than or equal to 3.9 mmol/L, retreat with another 15g CHO.
3. Continue to treat/test until BG is greater than or equal to 4.0 mmol/L.
4. If the next meal is more than 30 minutes away, provide a snack containing carbohydrate and protein (e.g., 1 slice of bread and 1 oz (30g) of cheese or meat).

### TREATMENT OF RESIDENT WHO IS UNCONSCIOUS OR UNABLE TO INGEST

1. Notify the physician/nurse practitioner immediately.
2. Administer glucagon if ordered by a physician or nurse practitioner.

### FOLLOWING A HYPOGLYCEMIC EVENT

1. Assess factors that may have contributed to the hypoglycemia, such as inadequate carbohydrate intake at meals, increased physical activity, or too much oral anti-hyperglycemic agent/insulin, and notify physician/nurse practitioner.
2. Implement strategies aimed at maintaining BG levels at goal and to prevent hypoglycemic episodes and update the care plan.
3. Refer the resident to the Registered Dietitian if blood glucose levels are consistently below goal range.
4. Request a physician/nurse practitioner review the antihyperglycemic agents/insulin if hypoglycemic episodes occur greater than once per month.
5. Notify the resident's substitute decision maker (SDM) for any resident who is incapable, of any episodes of hypoglycemia including ones that required the administration of glucagon.

### DOCUMENTATION

1. Document in the resident's health record actions taken pertaining to a hypoglycemic event, including:

## Hypoglycemia

### Procedures

1. Resident assessments before and after the hypoglycemic event;
2. Treatment provided;
3. Actions following a hypoglycemic event as noted above;
4. Any other relevant information; and
5. For Ontario only:
- i. Complete a report on all events of severe hypoglycemia, unresponsive hypoglycemia, and events that required the administration of glucagon. These events should be tracked in the Hypoglycemic Response Tool and Event Analysis in the home's electronic documentation system. If the home's system does not have the forms, homes can track these events using the reports in Appendix 1 and 2.
- ii. Notify the resident's attending physician/Nurse Practitioner (NP), the pharmacy service provider, prescriber of glucagon (if different from attending physician/NP), and the Director of Care or designate of each reportable hypoglycemic event, as part of the report completion process.

### All Staff

1. Report the following symptoms of low blood glucose levels immediately to the nurse:
- a. New or worsened trembling;
- b. Profuse sweating;
- c. Complaints of heart palpitations, fluttering or rapid heart beat; and
- d. New or worsened nausea, hunger, confusion, drowsiness, weakness, difficulty speaking and/or headache.
