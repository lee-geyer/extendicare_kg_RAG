## POLICY

### Privacy and Confidentiality Program

## PROCEDURE

### Release of Information/Access Request Process

Residents or their substitute decision makers (“SDM”) (a resident or an SDM, a “requestor”) have the right to access the resident’s personal health records by submitting a written health record access request.

The Executive Director/ Director of Care/ Designate will:

1. Review all resident or SDM consents for release of PHI received to ensure that:
- An original, witnessed consent copy has been signed by the resident (if competent), or SDM, Power of Attorney, or executor of the estate/legal representative (if resident is deceased).
- The consent sets out the specific information from the health record being requested and to whom the information is to be released.

2. Arrange for the health care records to be copied as per the request form.

3. Provide the requestor with a timely response after receipt of the request form indicating when the copied records will be ready.

4. Respond to the request within 30 calendar days unless otherwise directed by a provincial privacy commissioner standard or legislation. The response time may be extended to 60 calendar days if:
- The request does not provide enough detail to identify the records requested.
- The volume of records is large and providing a response sooner would unreasonably interfere with the operations of Extendicare.
- More time is needed to consult with another organization or resident before responding.

> **Note:** All access request time extensions must be approved by the Privacy Office at Privacy_Officer@extendicare.com.

5. Send to Privacy_Officer@extendicare.com any requests for records other than the health records (e.g., critical incident reports, investigative notes, policy).

6. Be aware that a basic fee may be charged for the release of information based on the fees set out in the Maximum Allowable Schedule.

> **Note:** For fees beyond the basic, contact Privacy_Officer@extendicare.com.

7. Consider any requests to waive the fee based on the ability to pay and extenuating circumstances.

8. Provide reasonable assistance to the requestor in understanding specific factual or technical terminology, codes, or other content in the information released to the resident.

9. Advise the requestor in writing if any information has been withheld or if correction has not been made, and the specific reasons for withholding or refusing to correct, in line with policy and legislation.

# PROCEDURE

## SECTION: Privacy and Confidentiality
## DESCRIPTION: Release of Information/ Access Requests
## INDEX: PRV1- P10.09

Document the following in the resident’s health care record:

- a. When the consent form was received;
- b. Name of the requestor for the release of information;
- c. Date and time the information was released;
- d. Name and address of the recipient of the information; and

**Alberta only:** Report all health record requests to Alberta Health local Access and Disclosure Centre.

### Withholding Information from an Access Request

The Executive Director/ Director of Care/ Designate will contact Privacy_Officer@extendicare.com when considering withholding health record information.

Residents have access rights to their own health information, unless one of the following exceptions apply:

- a. the disclosure reveals information about a resident other than the resident making the request;
- b. the information was collected or created as part of an investigation, disciplinary proceeding, practice review or an inspection related to provision of health services;
- c. provincial or federal legislation prohibits the disclosure, including pursuant to quality of care restrictions;
- d. the disclosure could reasonably be expected to result in immediate and grave harm to anyone’s mental or physical health or safety;
- e. the disclosure could lead to the identification of a person who provided health information to Extendicare in confidence;
- f. the information could reasonably be expected to prejudice the use or results of audits, diagnostic tests, or assessments;
- g. the information is subject to legal privilege;
- h. the disclosure is prohibited under an applicable provincial or federal law; or
- i. the disclosure could reasonably be expected to pose a threat to public safety.

When using discretion to withhold personal health information, Extendicare does not rely solely on a set decision-making policy or precedent for each exception, but assesses the circumstances of each case, including whether:

- a. release is in line with the general purposes of providing the resident as much access to their own personal health information as possible; or
- b. a significant amount of time has passed since the records were created.

When applying exceptions to information requested, Extendicare severs from the relevant record the information to which the exception applies so that the remainder of the record can be released to the requester.
