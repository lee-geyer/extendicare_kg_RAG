## Disaster Box Contents

Disaster boxes must be reviewed and maintained annually and as used to ensure all required items are available and in proper working order. Any time an item from the disaster box is removed/used it must be replaced.

- Prepare disaster boxes in advance of an emergency situation.
- Label disaster boxes boldly; ensure they are easily transportable, and store one in the designated location of the Emergency Operations Centre; and at least one in a Nursing station.
