## Floor Care Tips

In the absence of experienced judgment, known procedures will be used for stain removal to avoid damage and/or fixing the stain permanently into the floor.

### Stain Removal Methods

| **STAIN**                  | **REMOVAL METHOD**                                                                                     |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cigarette Burns            | If burns are not too deep remove with steel wool. Soap and water may make the steel wool more effective. Remove one spot at a time. |
| Alcoholic Beverages        | Clean with soap and water. If necessary, follow with denatured alcohol.                               |
| VCT Adhesives              | This problem applies only to newly laid VCT tile. Remove adhesive with steel wool and a detergent. Avoid using mineral solvent. For removal of plaster from VCT tile, soak with a 50-50 solution of vinegar and water. |
| Blood                      | Follow blood spill cleaning procedure.                                                                  |
| Chewing Gum                | Remove gum with putty knife. Clean the area with alcohol to remove remaining stickiness.
**Note:** If this method does not work buy a gum removal agent from your housekeeping supplier. This product will freeze the gum for easy removal. |

Periodically, the floors will be inspected for maintenance problems and finish deterioration. Determine the cause of problems and take corrective measures. Typical floor problems and causes are outlined below.
