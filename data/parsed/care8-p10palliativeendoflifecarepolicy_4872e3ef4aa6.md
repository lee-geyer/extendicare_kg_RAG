## POLICY

Extendicare enhances residents' quality of life through a holistic, resident-centred palliative care approach that promotes well-being, dignity, and respect for resident values, beliefs, and wishes throughout their care journey, including end-of-life care.

## STANDARD

- The palliative care approach must recognize the ‘whole’ resident, inclusive of physical, psychological, emotional, social, and spiritual well-being, regardless of health status.
- All residents can benefit from a palliative care approach that identifies key care priorities throughout the palliative stages, including:
- Pain and symptom management
- Discomfort alleviation
- Addressing nutrition needs to enhance their quality of life.
- The home is required to appoint a regulated health professional as the Palliative Lead. Through collaboration with the interdisciplinary team, the Palliative Lead will oversee the program, including:
- Coordinating and/or facilitating education of an integrated palliative care approach.
- Meeting at minimum quarterly with the interdisciplinary team.
- Nursing must conduct ongoing assessments to identify palliative care needs based on changes in health status, guiding treatment options, and referrals to other support services as needed.
- Any member of the interdisciplinary team can initiate a Referral-Palliative Lead for various reasons, including:
- Admission
- Family inquiries
- Education
- Care plan development
- Changes in palliative stages or the Palliative Performance Scale.
- Residents are to be encouraged to participate in advanced care planning, including:
- Appointing a Substitute Decision Maker (SDM)
- Expressing care preferences, in accordance with regional/provincial regulations and standards.
- Residents’ autonomy in decision-making, including the right to refuse treatment, must be respected and is to include opportunities to be involved in care decisions. The resident/POA/SDM must receive a clear explanation of all palliative care options, including end-of-life care, to be integrated into the Plan of Care.
- Extendicare supports resident and family-centred care and acknowledges the right of eligible residents to choose Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID) as an option in the continuum of end-of-life care.
- When death is imminent, the interdisciplinary team prioritizes comfort care by discontinuing life-sustaining treatments in line with the resident’s wishes.
