**Note:** A PCRA is to be performed prior to contact with every resident, every time, even if the resident has been placed on Additional Precautions as more PPE may be required.

**Environment:** Any area within 2 metres of the resident as well as their belongings and bathroom or the immediate space around a resident that may be touched by the resident AND may also be touched by staff when providing care or performing tasks.

If COVID-19 is suspected/probable/confirmed, use the PCRA to guide PPE use during the COVID-19 pandemic that adopts Universal PPE Strategies.
