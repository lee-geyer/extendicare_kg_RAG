## POLICY

### Cleaning and Disinfection

### PROCEDURE

- Personal humidifiers are not allowed in the home due to the potential adverse risks to both health and building systems and to eliminate the spread of airborne pathogens inherent to uncontrolled indoor humidification.
- Inform the resident/Substitute Decision-Maker (SDM) upon admission that personal humidifiers are not permitted in the home and explain the rationale.
- Document any communication with a resident/SDM or family member regarding personal humidifier use in progress notes.
- Remove existing humidifiers. Document the discussion and the date the humidifier was removed from the home in progress notes.
- Oversee the implementation of the Personal Humidifiers procedure in the home and ensure procedures are communicated to anyone who has a relationship with the home.

### Rationale

Studies indicate that certain levels of indoor relative humidity can have effects on health. Too low or too high indoor relative humidity has been shown to increase the rates of respiratory illness and contribute to the growth of mould and fungi within buildings. Humidifiers that atomize water to generate micro-sized droplets in the air (referred to as an aerosol) can potentially distribute any microbial contaminants present in that water or in biofilms that develop on humidifier tanks, reservoirs, and spouts. Contaminated room humidifiers have been linked to both health care-acquired and community-acquired infections. Standing water in humidifiers/diffusers has been linked as the source of Legionnaires’ disease and Pontiac fever, as well as other airborne pathogens affected by levels of indoor relative humidity.
