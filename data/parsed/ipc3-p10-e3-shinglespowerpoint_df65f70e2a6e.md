# What is Shingles?

Shingles is often a debilitating illness.

- In the short term, shingles is painful and can be disfiguring.
- It often occurs on the face and eyes.
- About 1 in 5 will suffer long term nerve damage which can cause excruciating and unrelenting pain for months and in some cases even years.
- The pain can disturb sleep, appetite, mood, and activities of daily living.

# How do residents get shingles?

- The virus that causes chicken pox (varicella zoster) becomes reactivated in the body.
- The varicella zoster virus does not leave the body even after the person recovers from chicken pox, and when the personâ€™s immune system is weakened, the virus can reactivate to cause what is commonly known as Shingles.

# What are the symptoms?

- **Painful rash**
- The affected area will often itch, tingle, and for most residents be painful.
- The rash can occur anywhere on the body and consists of a group of small fluid-filled blisters.
- Scratching a rash can cause a secondary infection.
- In severe cases, shingles around the eyes can cause blindness.

# Transmission

- Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another.
- However, the virus that causes shingles, the varicella zoster virus, can be spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox.
- In this case, the person may develop chickenpox but not shingles.

# Transmission of Shingles

- The virus is spread through direct contact with the fluid from the rash blisters caused by shingles.
- In some cases (i.e., disseminated), the virus can be spread through the airborne route as well.
- A person with active shingles can spread the virus when the rash is in blister-phase. A person is not infectious before the blisters appear. Once the rash has developed crusts, the person is no longer contagious.
- Shingles is less contagious than chickenpox and the risk of spreading the virus is low if the rash is covered.

# Who is most at risk of getting Shingles?

- Usually, people over 50
- Weakened immune system

# Stopping the Spread of the Virus

- Use contact, and sometimes airborne and contact precautions when providing care to a resident who has Shingles.
- Shingles vaccine.
- Wash your hands.

**Note:** Pregnant women who have not had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine should be reassigned when possible.
