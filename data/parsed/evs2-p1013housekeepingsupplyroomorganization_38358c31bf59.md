### DESCRIPTION: Housekeeping

### INDEX: EVS2-P10.13

FIFO is “first in first out” and simply means you need to label your items with the dates you store them and put the older items in front or on top so that you use them first. This system allows you to find your supplies quicker and use them more efficiently.

To ensure using certain date-sensitive items prior to expiration, focus your choices on the FIFO principle by using the earliest purchased item and whose shelf life is the shortest first.
