This approach emphasizes resident strengths, promotes independence, and maximizes participation in meaningful Activities of Daily Living (ADLs).1. The interRAI assessment must be completed by the interdisciplinary team, including a review of relevant respiratory indicators such as:\n- Dyspnea\n- Oxygen use\n- ADL performance\n- Diagnoses\n- Recurring respiratory infections\n- Any assessment protocols2. The nurse conducting the interRAI review must refer to the Restorative Care Coordinating Committee, where the Restorative Care Lead will complete the Restorative – Needs Assessment & Evaluation to determine the resident’s capacity for improvement and suitability for restorative respiratory therapies.3. The Restorative Care Co-Lead, in collaboration with the interdisciplinary team, may also coordinate referrals and assessments by Extendicare’s preferred respiratory service provider as needed.4.",

An individualized plan of care must be developed with the resident and/or Substitute Decision Maker (SDM)/Power of Attorney (POA) based on assessment findings. Plans must specify treatment types, frequency, and duration.----**Helping people live better**This document is uncontrolled when printed.
