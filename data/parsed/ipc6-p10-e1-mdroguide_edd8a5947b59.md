# Multi-Drug Resistant Organism (MDRO)

## What is an MDRO?
A multi-drug resistant organism is a microorganism that has developed resistance to the action of several antimicrobial agents and is of special clinical or epidemiologic significance. Organisms classified as an MDRO include MRSA, VRE, EBSL, CPE, C. diff, and C. auris.

## Who can get an MDRO?
Most MDRO infections occur among people in hospitals and other healthcare settings. Outbreaks are thought to be more common in healthcare settings because they often affect people who are older, are very ill, have a compromised immune system, or suffer from chronic conditions which make them more susceptible to infection.

## How is an MDRO transmitted?
Most often, MDROs spread from resident to resident on the hands of healthcare workers. They can also spread by contact with contaminated objects such as medication cart handles, bed rails, bedside tables, IV poles, and catheters, etc. They can also transmit person-to-person through direct physical contact. Proper hand hygiene and contact precautions reduce the risk of transmission.

## How does drug resistance occur?
When antibiotics are used frequently, or for lengthy periods of time, microorganisms can develop resistance and will not be destroyed by certain drugs. This can occur when someone is given a prescription of antibiotics and does not complete the course/dosage (i.e., stops taking them) because they begin to feel better. Microorganisms may not be completely killed and, in this way, they can develop resistance to the drug.

## How to monitor an MDRO?
Extendicare’s Infection Surveillance policy requires tracking and documenting of all infections daily. The policy also sets out requirements for determining trends by reviewing, analyzing, and comparing the infection rates to the previous two months in addition to the same month of the previous year. The Monthly Infection Surveillance Form allows for monitoring of infections present in the home and can be reviewed to generate statistics for the Monthly Infection Electronic Workbook. Antibiotic use must also be reviewed monthly and trends discussed with the home’s Medical Director, physicians, and pharmacies. Consideration must be given to reduce the use of antibiotics while still safeguarding and caring for residents.

# Using Routine Practices to Manage MDROs

**ROUTINE PRACTICES** reduce the risk of disease-causing organism transmission when applied consistently. Routine Practices include 3 components:

1. Point of Care Risk Assessment (PCRA)
2. Hand Hygiene
3. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

## Hand Hygiene

Hand hygiene is the most important infection prevention and control practice for preventing transmission of infections. As healthcare worker hands are continuously in contact with residents and their environments, they are the most at risk of contamination during resident care with potential transfer of organisms in person-to-person contact (staff and residents) and contact with contaminated surfaces in their environment.

Hand hygiene must ALWAYS be performed:

- Before and after resident contact;
- Between tasks on the same resident;
- After contact with potentially contaminated items;
- Before donning gloves;
- Immediately after gloves are removed;
- Before leaving the resident’s room;

**Note:** Hand washing for C. difficile must be done using soap and water. Alcohol-Based Hand Rub (ABHR) is not effective against C. difficile spores.

After hand hygiene is performed, ensure hands do not touch potentially contaminated environmental surfaces or items in the resident’s room to avoid transfer of microorganisms.

**Note:** Remind and encourage residents to maintain good hand hygiene. Provide hand washing assistance to those residents who are confused or unable to wash their hands on their own. All MDRO-positive residents must wash their hands before eating; immediately prior to leaving their room; after using the toilet, bed pan or commode; or, whenever their hands become soiled.

## Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

Wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) is a healthcare worker’s first line of protection by minimizing exposure to infectious microorganisms. When caring for residents with communicable infections, personal protective equipment such as gloves, gowns, and eye protection is used to interrupt the transmission. Determination of which PPE is appropriate to use can be made using a PCRA.

### GLOVES

- Must always be worn to enter the room of a resident on contact precautions for colonization or infection with an MDRO.
- Must be changed between tasks on the same resident or between residents.
- Must be removed and disposed of once care is complete, and hand hygiene performed prior to leaving the resident’s room.
- Failure to remove gloves after resident care may result in contamination of the environment.

### GOWN

- Use of single-use disposable gown is recommended.
- Wear a long-sleeved gown if there is a risk of contamination to worker’s exposed skin (forearms) and clothing.
- Must be changed between residents.
- Must only be worn once.
- Remove the gown and discard it in the laundry or garbage bag before leaving the resident’s room.
- After gown removal, ensure that clothing does not contact potential contaminated environmental surfaces to avoid transfer of microorganisms.

# About C. auris

## CANDIDA AURIS

### What is C. auris?
Candida auris is an emerging fungal pathogen capable of causing invasive disease, particularly in critically ill patient populations. Following recognition of this pathogen in Japan in 2009, it has spread globally resulting in persistent and difficult to control hospital outbreaks. Unlike Candida albicans, the majority of C. auris isolates are resistant to fluconazole. Resistance to other azoles, polyenes (e.g., amphotericin B) and echinocandins also occurs. There is little available information on how antifungal resistance is acquired in C. auris but the development of resistance while on therapy has been observed.

### Who is at Risk of C. auris?
Residents at risk for C. auris include those who:
- have had recent surgeries;
- are diabetic;
- use broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals;
- have invasive medical devices such as breathing tubes, feeding tubes, and central venous catheters; and
- have frequently stays in health care settings, particularly in long-term acute care hospitals and long-term care homes that provide ventilator care.

### How C. auris is spread
C. auris is transmitted from one person to another by direct contact (unwashed hands). Transmission through indirect contact can also occur after handling contaminated material or equipment. C. auris is not spread through the air but can persist on surfaces and multi-use equipment for extended periods of time. Risk factors for C. auris acquisition should be identified for any resident who tests positive for C. auris, including prior hospitalization or receipt of health care (e.g., dialysis, day surgery) at a Canadian health care facility where C. auris transmission has occurred, or a health care facility outside Canada.
```

# The difference between C. auris infection and C. auris colonization

C. auris can cause invasive infection (e.g., bloodstream, intra-abdominal) requiring antifungal therapy. However, C. auris also has been found in noninvasive body sites and can colonize a person without causing active infection. These sites include urine, external ear canal, wounds, and respiratory specimens. Because C. auris has also been found on the skin, colonization can also be determined by screening swab. It is important to note that recommended infection control measures are the same for both infection and colonization with C. auris.

## Managing C. auris

Every identified case of C. auris, regardless of the degree of antimicrobial resistance, requires immediate investigation to determine the probable source of C. auris and to assess the risk of transmission within the facility.

C. auris can be transmitted rapidly within a health care setting, with one home documenting C. auris transmission between residents based on exposures as short as 4 hours. Thus, when homes identify residents with C. auris, all roommates and contacts should have testing performed for C. auris regardless of the duration of exposure.

For homes that have never identified C. auris, the identification of a single case is a sentinel event that should trigger a full investigation, and the identification of two cases—even if they are on different home areas and present months apart—should be considered an outbreak even if no direct linkage between cases is apparent. For all C. auris cases, notify the local public health authority.

## C. auris IPAC Precautions

### SCREENING

- If the resident meets criteria for C. auris screening, the screening should include a single bilateral swab of a resident’s axilla and groin. In addition, single swabs of previously colonized or clinically relevant sites may also be indicated (i.e., wounds, exit sites of devices, external ear canal).
- Even after treatment for invasive infections, residents generally remain colonized with C. auris for long periods, and perhaps indefinitely. Therefore, all recommended infection control measures should be followed during and after treatment for C. auris infection.

# C. auris IPAC Precautions

## ROOM PLACEMENT
- A single/private room with dedicated toileting facilities (not shared with other residents) is recommended for C. auris-positive residents.
- If a single room is not possible, regardless of patient colonization or infection status:
- Maintain spatial separation of at least two metres between beds.
- Ensure roommates are made aware of, and comply with any precautions that are being taken.
- Use privacy curtains to limit direct contact.

## BATHROOMS
- Use dedicated toileting facilities (toilet or commode) not shared with other residents.
- Residents must have their own towels and toiletries, which must not be shared with others.

## COMMUNICATION OF PRECAUTIONS
- Routine practices (i.e., proper hand hygiene technique and practices) and contact precautionary measures must be communicated to anyone (e.g., healthcare workers, volunteers, family, and visitors) entering the resident’s room using Extendicare’s Contact Precautions poster.
- Transfer of residents colonized or infected with C. auris within or between facilities should be avoided unless medically necessary and for transitions of care (such as acute care to LTC). The receiving unit, department, or facility must be notified in advance. All healthcare facilities should be able to manage patients with C. auris, and C. auris colonization/infection should not be a reason to refuse the transfer.
- Must include notations on the resident’s chart and care plan which are necessary to alert staff to the need for precautions in addition to basic infection control practices.

## EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
- Single-use and disposable resident care supplies should be used for a patient with C. auris whenever possible.
- Reusable, non-critical patient care equipment and supplies should be identified and stored in the patient’s room, dedicated to the patient for their admission, and appropriately cleaned and disinfected before use on another patient. These items must be cleaned, disinfected, or discarded after the resident is discharged or taken off precautions.
- Items shared between residents (i.e., shower chair, bathtub, mechanical lifts) must be cleaned and disinfected after each use.

## LAUNDRY
- Treat resident’s linen as isolation linen, and the policy and procedure for handling isolation linen must be followed (refer to policy, Processing Isolation Linen in the Housekeeping and Laundry Services Manual).

## HOUSEKEEPING
- Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide (AHP) is an effective agent against C. auris while quaternary ammonium compounds are not. Therefore, quaternary ammonium compounds should not be used for disinfection of the environment or medical equipment potentially exposed to C. auris.
- Room surfaces and equipment cleaning/disinfection is required twice daily using approved products and procedures.
```

# C. auris IPAC Precautions

- Clean thoroughly and frequently with a sporicidal disinfectant (i.e., Accel Rescue). Remove organic soil by cleaning (using rubbing action) first, and then disinfect. Ensure contact time per manufacturer’s direction is followed for all chemicals (i.e., contact time for Accel Rescue is 10 minutes). Cleaning cloths are to be changed frequently, after each task (surface).
- Gloves must always be worn and changed between each resident bed area.
- Always clean the bathroom last and use separate cleaning equipment.
- Clean all furnishings and surfaces in contact with residents and staff.

## In shared rooms:
- Clean and disinfect as if each bed area were a different room.
- Clean and disinfect any shared or reusable equipment.
- Change mopheads, cleaning cloths, and other cleaning equipment between bed areas.
- Clean and disinfect environmental surfaces on a more frequent schedule.

- Perform routine terminal cleaning, with AHP, when precautions are discontinued, or the resident is transferred or discharged as per policy, Resident Room Cleaning on Discharge/Room Change in the Housekeeping and Laundry Services Manual.
- Follow routine practices for disposal of biohazardous waste.
- Waste/garbage can be discarded into the home’s general waste. Double bagging is not required unless the bag is leaking.

# RESIDENT ACTIVITIES
- Resident participation in the home’s activities should not be restricted unless body fluids cannot be contained. Resident may leave the room if:
- Contamination of the environment is unlikely, as assessed.
- They perform (or are assisted with) proper hand washing or hand rubbing with an alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR); and
- Body fluids are contained by secure, occlusive dressing(s) or drainage collection system(s).

# MEALS AND EATING UTENSILS
- Regular dishes and cutlery may be used, disposable dishes are not required.
- The resident may participate in regular meal activities.
- Ensure the resident performs (or is assisted with) proper hand washing or hand rubbing with an alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) before going into the common dining area.

# BATHING
- Can be conducted as per regular bathing schedule.
- Ensure the tub/shower, shower chair, and/or any other bathing/showering equipment/item is cleaned and disinfected after each use.

# VISITORS AND VOLUNTEERS
- Ensure visitors and volunteers:
- wash their hands before entering and before leaving the resident’s room; and
- are aware of precautions in place and proper hand hygiene techniques.

# DISCONTINUATION OF PRECAUTIONS
- It is recommended to continue Contact Precautions for the entire duration of the resident’s stay in the long-term care home.
- It is not recommended to routinely reassess for C. auris colonization as colonization persists for a prolonged period. Repeat colonization swabs may alternate between detecting and not detecting C. auris. Surveillance has identified individuals that remained colonized for longer than 2 years.

# About CPE

## CARBAPENEMASE-PRODUCING ENTEROBACTERALES

### What is CPE?
Enterobacteriaceae are a family of gram-negative bacteria, many of which live naturally in a person’s gastrointestinal tract. Commonly encountered Enterobacteriaceae include Klebsiella species, Escherichia coli (E. coli), and Enterobacter species.

Carbapenems are a class of antibiotics that includes ertapenem, imipenem, and meropenem. They are among the strongest antibiotics and are used for treating infections that are difficult to treat.

CPE are Enterobacteriaceae that produce enzymes (i.e., carbapenemases) that inactivate carbapenems and several other classes of antibiotics. This causes infections that are difficult to treat, with mortality up to 50% of severely infected persons.

CPE can cause infections in any part of the body, including:
- pneumonia
- bloodstream infections
- intra-abdominal infections
- urinary tract infections
- central venous catheter infections

**Note:** All CPE colonizations and infections are reportable.

### How CPE is Transmitted
Most residents who carry CPE have no symptoms of infection and are said to be colonized. The main site of colonization of CPE is the bowel. CPE is not spread through the air, but may survive on equipment and surfaces, such as bedrails, tables, chairs, countertops, and door handles. CPE can be spread directly or indirectly from person to person by:
1. Touching contaminated surfaces or medical equipment that have the bacteria on it; and/or
2. Unclean hands that can carry the germ. Health care workers and visitors can spread it to other residents if they do not clean their hands properly.

Infection occurs when CPE enters the body at specific sites and causes symptoms of disease. For example, CPE can cause pneumonia and urinary tract infections. Since CPE are resistant to many types of antibiotics, treatment is difficult and may involve antibiotics which have significant side effects.

# Assessing the Risk of CPE Transmission

A long-term care home is a resident’s home, and precautions used to decrease transmission of CPE must be balanced with promoting a home-like environment. Effective hand hygiene is essential to limit CPE transmission.

## Initiate Contact Precautions for Residents with CPE, Including:

1. Appropriate resident placement.
2. Wearing gloves for all activities in the room or bed environment for direct care of residents.
3. Removing and discarding gloves immediately after the activity for which they were used. Also, change or remove gloves if moving from a contaminated body site to a clean body site within the same individual or before touching the environment. Remember to clean your hands after removing gloves.
4. Wearing a long-sleeved gown for activities where skin or clothing may contact the resident or their environment and for direct care of residents.
5. Dedicating equipment and effectively cleaning and disinfecting shared equipment after each use.
6. In the event of an outbreak, cohorting of residents, staff assignments, and equipment is essential to prevent further transmission.

## CPE IPAC Precautions

### SCREENING

If the resident meets the criteria for screening, primary screening specimens for CPE include stool or rectal (peri-anal) swabs as well as swabs from open wounds and urine specimens, if indicated. If the resident was found to be positive after being admitted into the home, other residents in proximity (e.g., roommates, cohorts, residents that share the same bathroom, etc.) must be tested for CPE.

For residents who are contacts of confirmed CPE cases, a minimum of 3 sets of specimens are taken on different days. At least one of the specimens must be taken 21 days after the last exposure. Re-screening is required if ongoing exposure/transmission takes place.

Once a resident has cultured positive for CPE, contact precautions must be initiated. If the resident’s physician decides to attempt decolonization, swabs should be taken weekly of positive body sites and should be initiated 48 hours after completion of antibiotic therapy.

# CPE IPAC Precautions

## ROOM PLACEMENT
- A single/private room with individual toileting facilities is preferable.
- When a private room is not available, a resident who has CPE may share a room with another resident with CPE (cohorting) but with no other infection or share with a roommate who is a minimal risk for CPE acquisition or infection. Characteristics of a low-risk roommate include:
- Free of open wounds (surgical incisions or decubitus ulcers);
- Free of invasive devices (urinary catheters, IV, gastrostomy tubes or tracheotomies);
- Not debilitated or bed-bound requiring extensive hands-on care.
- CPE precautions must be maintained with each resident. In a shared bedroom, PPE must be changed between each resident when providing care even if both residents have CPE.

## BATHROOMS
- Separate toilet, washing or bathing facilities are preferable.
- If separate toilets are not available, provide a commode for the resident with CPE.
- Residents must have their own towels and toiletries, which must not be shared.

## COMMUNICATION OF PRECAUTIONS
- Routine practices (i.e., proper hand hygiene technique and practices) and contact precautionary measures must be communicated to anyone (e.g., healthcare workers, volunteers, family and visitors) entering the resident’s room using Extendicare’s Contact Precautions poster, or as provincially mandated.
- Must include notations on the resident’s chart and care plan necessary to alert staff to the need for additional precautions in addition to routine practices.
- Will be shared with the receiving provider and/or ambulance staff if the resident requires transfer.

## EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
- All items inside the resident’s room are considered contaminated.
- Blood pressure cuffs, stethoscopes, thermometers, pulse oximeters, commodes, walkers, wheelchairs and transfer slings etc. should be dedicated to the resident/resident room whenever possible. These items are to be cleaned and disinfected after the resident is discharged or taken off precautions.
- Equipment and supplies shared between residents (e.g., shower chair, bathtub, mechanical lifts) must be cleaned and disinfected after each use.

## LAUNDRY
- If the resident is symptomatic, the resident’s linen is to be treated as isolation linen, and the policy and procedure for handling isolation linen must be followed (refer to policy Processing Isolation Linen in the Housekeeping and Laundry Services Manual).
- If the resident is not symptomatic, routine laundry cleaning should be sufficient.
```

```markdown
# CPE IPAC Precautions

## HOUSEKEEPING
- Use Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide (AHP) disinfectant. All surfaces are to be cleaned twice. Ensure contact time per manufacturer’s directions is followed for all chemicals.
- Particular attention must be paid to the cleaning and disinfection of sinks, as they can contribute to the transmission of the pathogen. Ensure environmental swabs of the drains are performed prior to final cleaning/disinfection of the resident’s room (use Twice Daily Cleaning Checklist – Sporicidal Disinfectant, from the policy, C. Difficile Room Cleaning in the Housekeeping and Laundry Services Manual).
- Routine terminal cleaning, using AHP, when precautions are discontinued, or the resident is transferred or discharged as per policy/procedure is required. Clean surfaces twice, changing cleaning cloths frequently between each task (surface).
- Follow the policy, Isolation Room Cleaning in the Housekeeping and Laundry Services Manual.

## RESIDENT ACTIVITIES
- Encourage residents to perform hand hygiene when exiting their room and before any activities.
- Resident participation in activities should not be restricted.

## MEALS AND EATING UTENSILS
- Regular dishes and cutlery may be used; disposable dishes are not required.
- If the resident goes to the common dining room, ensure that the resident’s hands are washed prior to entering.
- Resident may participate in regular meal activities.

## BATHING
- Conducted as per regular bathing schedule.
- Ensure the tub/shower is cleaned and disinfected after each use following Cleaning and Disinfection policy, Tubs and Showers in the IPAC Manual.

## VISITORS AND VOLUNTEERS
- Must wash their hands when leaving the resident’s room.
- Require individual assessment of need for education on barrier precautions, including correct application of gloves, gown and/or mask.

## DISCONTINUATION OF PRECAUTIONS
- CPE-positive residents should be kept on Contact Precautions indefinitely, due to the risk of prolonged colonization and the implications of CPE infection and transmission.
- For close contacts, contact precautions can be discontinued after the screening process is completed, or as directed by the local public health authority.

# About C. diff

## CLOSTRIDIOIDES DIFFICILE

### What is C. diff?
C. difficile is a bacterium that causes diarrhea and more serious intestinal conditions like colitis (or inflammation of the colon). It is one of the most common diarrheal infections in hospitals and long-term care homes. The bacterium was formerly (2016) named Clostridium difficile.

Most cases of C. difficile occur in persons who are taking certain antibiotics in high doses or over a prolonged period of time. Some antibiotics can destroy a person’s normal bacteria found in the gut, allowing C. difficile bacteria to grow.

### How C. diff is Transmitted
C. difficile is found in stool and is transmitted from one person to another by direct contact (unwashed hands) or through indirect contact after handling contaminated material or equipment. Healthy people do not usually get C. difficile. Those with other illnesses or conditions requiring antibiotics and the elderly are at greater risk.

### How Antibiotic Use Contributes to the Development of C. diff
Treatment with antibiotics alters the normal levels of good bacteria that are naturally found in the intestines and colon. When there are fewer good bacteria, C. difficile has the chance to thrive and produce toxins resulting in the development of C. difficile diarrhea.
```

# C. difficile Symptoms

Symptoms of C. difficile include:
- Watery diarrhea
- Fever
- Loss of appetite
- Nausea
- Abdominal pain/tenderness

## How to Decrease the Risk of C. difficile Transmission

The risk of transmission of C. difficile can be reduced by compliance with hand hygiene and contact precautions. It is also important for residents, visitors, families, and volunteers to perform hand hygiene.

## C. diff IPAC Precautions

### SCREENING

Clostridioides difficile infection may be suspected in residents with new onset of diarrhea who have 3 or more unformed (loose/watery) stools in a 24-hour period. To determine if a resident has C. diff, consider both clinical symptoms and lab test results.

Before submitting a stool sample for C. diff lab testing, consider other causes of loose stools. This could include medications (stool softeners, etc.) or underlying conditions such as Crohn’s or bowel surgery. Note the following when submitting stool for lab testing:

- Fresh stool is required.
- Collect specimen in a clean, watertight container.
- C. difficile toxin is very unstable and degrades at room temperature in as short as two hours. False negative results occur when specimens are not kept refrigerated until testing can be done.
- Transport specimens as soon as possible and store at 2 - 8 °C until tested. Storage at room temperature may decrease the sensitivity of some tests, possibly due to toxin inactivation.

**Note:** Testing after C. diff symptoms are resolved is not recommended as toxin may persist in stool for weeks to months despite resolution of illness.

```markdown
# C. diff IPAC Precautions

## ROOM PLACEMENT
- Isolation in a single room is preferred if the resident is incontinent (i.e., feces that cannot be contained) or the resident has poor hygiene that might lead to contamination of the surrounding environment.
- If a single room is not possible, maintain spatial separation of at least one metre between the infected resident(s) and other residents and their visitors. If sharing a room:
- Roommates should not have serious medical conditions that would put them at risk for C. difficile (i.e., end stage renal disease, cancer or immunodeficiency);
- Roommates and all visitors must be made aware of, and should comply with any precautions that are being taken.
- Residents with C. difficile may share a room unless transmission of different strains is a concern. Consultation with the home’s Infection Control Practitioner is advised before resident placement.

## BATHROOMS
- An individual commode must be designated to the symptomatic resident.
- Separate toilet, washing or bathing facilities are preferable.
- Residents must have their own towels and toiletries, which must not be shared with others.

## COMMUNICATION OF PRECAUTIONS
- Routine practices (i.e., proper hand hygiene technique and practices) and contact precautionary measures must be communicated to anyone (e.g., healthcare workers, volunteers, family and visitors) entering the resident’s room using Extendicare’s Contact Precautionary signage.
- Must follow Extendicare’s policy/procedure and local public health authority directives.
- Must include notations on the resident’s chart and care plan necessary to alert staff to the need for additional precautions in addition to routine practices.
- Will be shared with the receiving provider and/or ambulance staff if the resident requires transfer.

## EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
- Blood pressure cuffs, stethoscopes, thermometers, pulse oximeters, etc. should be dedicated to the resident/resident room. These items are to be cleaned and disinfected or discarded after the resident is discharged or taken off precautions.
- Equipment and supplies shared between residents (e.g., shower chair, bathtub, commode, mechanical lifts) must be cleaned and disinfected after each use.
- Disposable, sterile trays must be used for dressings; catheterization, etc. and equipment should be discarded after use.

## LAUNDRY
- If the resident is symptomatic, the resident’s linen is to be treated as isolation linen, and the policy and procedure for handling isolation linen must be followed (refer to policy Processing Isolation Linen in the Housekeeping and Laundry Services Manual).
```

# About ESBL
## EXTENDED SPECTRUM BETA LACTAMASE PRODUCING BACTERIA

### What is ESBL?
There are specific bacteria that produce enzymes called Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase (ESBLs). These enzymes can break down many common antibiotics and make them ineffective in fighting infection caused by bacteria. Certain strains of *E. coli* produce ESBL (these do not include the strain of *E. coli* that causes food poisoning). Another bacterium, *Klebsiella*, also produces ESBL however slightly different than those produced by *E. coli*. Frequent and prolonged use of antibiotics can cause this resistance to develop.

### Clinical Presentation of ESBL
ESBL producing bacteria can cause urinary tract infections, wound infections or pneumonia. These infections can sometimes progress to cause more serious infections such as septicemia which can be life threatening. ESBLs break down the commonly prescribed antibiotics used to treat these common infections. This potentially allows the infection to worsen and there is increased risk of mortality.

### Risk Factors for ESBL
ESBL-producing bacteria do not usually cause illness in healthy individuals. Risk factors for ESBL include:
- Being critically ill;
- Having a weakened immune system;
- Hospitalization;
- Having an open wound, catheter or drainage tube;
- Previous treatment with many antibiotics.

### How ESBL is Spread
ESBL is found in stool and is transmitted from one person to another by direct contact (unwashed hands). Transmission through indirect contact can also occur after handling contaminated material or equipment. ESBL is not spread through the air.
```

```markdown
# ESBL Colonization vs. Infection

If a person is colonized with ESBL, these bacteria live in their bowel or urine but are not causing any illness. Treatment is not recommended for colonization; however, people who are colonized should practice good hand hygiene, especially after toileting, as they could potentially contaminate their environment. If a person is infected with ESBL producing bacteria, it is important to quickly diagnose this and recognize that the bacteria are resistant to many antibiotics so that the most appropriate treatment can be prescribed.

## What is Asymptomatic Bacteriuria (ASB)?

ASB is the presence of bacteria in urine. There are several definitions of ASB, but common elements in the definitions include:

- Positive urine cultures
- Absence of typical urinary infection symptoms such as:
- Fever (< 38 °C)
- Urgency
- Frequency
- Dysuria (painful or difficult urination)
- Suprapubic tenderness

It is often difficult to determine the etiology of an acute change in clinical status, particularly in the elderly. However, acute changes in clinical status are less likely to be the result of a urinary tract infection if local genitourinary findings are absent. ASB is common in the elderly population. This population can have colonization with bacteria that does not cause infection. Treatment of ASB exposes the resident to the risk of adverse drug effects and increases the chance of subsequent colonization or infection with more drug-resistant organisms.

## How to limit the development of ESBL

- Test and treat only symptomatic urinary tract infections unless the resident is pre-operative.
- Limit the use, frequency, and duration of catheterization.
- Use narrow-spectrum antibiotics as a first-line treatment.

## How to decrease the risk of transmission

- The risk of transmission of ESBL can be reduced by strict compliance with hand hygiene and Contact Precautions.
- It is also very important for residents, visitors, families, and volunteers to perform hand hygiene.

# ESBL IPAC Precautions

## SCREENING
- Screen residents following Multi-Drug Resistant Organism (MDRO) Screening Algorithm (in the IPAC Manual).
- The preferred specimen for ESBL screening is rectal swab or stool. A urine culture may be indicated in some residents such as those with indwelling catheters.

## ROOM PLACEMENT
- The decision to isolate individuals affected by ESBL should be based on clinical needs and a risk assessment.
- Control measures must be informed by a risk assessment that includes:
- The extent and site of resident infection
- The presence of a urinary catheter
- Whether the resident is incontinent
- Adherence to hygienic practices
- The susceptibility to infection of other residents
- Residents with ESBL and incontinence or urinary catheters or intra-abdominal drains are at a higher risk of spreading ESBL and therefore should be given priority for a private room whenever possible.

## BATHROOMS
- If it is decided that a resident needs to be placed on Contact Precautions, separate toileting facilities (e.g., commodes and bedpans) must be arranged. Every effort should be made to avoid sharing toileting facilities between the residents.
- Ensure resident washes hands with soap and water after bathroom use.

## COMMUNICATION OF PRECAUTIONS
- Routine practices (i.e., proper hand hygiene technique and practices) and contact precautionary measures must be communicated to anyone (e.g., healthcare workers, volunteers, family, and visitors) entering the resident’s room using Extendicare’s Contact Precautions poster.
- Must include notations on the resident’s chart and care plan necessary to alert staff to the need for precautions in addition to basic infection control practices.
- Will be shared with the receiving provider and/or ambulance staff if the resident requires transfer.

## EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
- Blood pressure cuffs, stethoscopes, thermometers, pulse oximeters, commodes, walkers, wheelchairs, and transfer slings should be dedicated to the resident/resident room whenever possible. These items must be cleaned and disinfected or discarded after the resident is discharged or taken off precautions.
- Shared between residents (e.g., shower chair, bathtub, mechanical lifts) must be cleaned and disinfected after each use.

## LAUNDRY
- If the resident is symptomatic, treat resident’s linen as isolation linen, and the policy and procedure for handling isolation linen must be followed (refer to policy, Processing Isolation Linen in the Housekeeping and Laundry Services Manual).
```

# ESBL IPAC Precautions

## HOUSEKEEPING
- If the resident is asymptomatic there is no need to change the daily cleaning practices.
- If the resident is symptomatic or the home is in outbreak daily cleaning must be performed.
- Thorough frequent cleaning with Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide (AHP) is required.
- Each time the room is cleaned all surfaces need to be cleaned twice. The first time to remove organic soil and the second time to disinfect.
- Ensure contact time per manufacturer’s directions is followed for all chemicals.
- Gloves must be worn.
- The bathroom is always cleaned last.
- Clean all furnishings and surfaces in contact with residents and staff.
- Perform routine terminal cleaning, with AHP, when precautions are discontinued, or the resident is transferred or discharged as per policy, Resident Room Cleaning on Discharge/Room Change in the Housekeeping and Laundry Services Manual.
- Follow home process for disposal of biohazardous waste. Waste/garbage can be discarded into general waste. Double bagging is not required unless the bag is leaking.

## RESIDENT ACTIVITIES
- Resident participation in the home’s activities should not be restricted unless body fluids cannot be contained. Resident may leave the room if:
- Contamination of the environment is unlikely, as assessed.
- They perform (or are assisted with) proper hand washing or hand rubbing with an alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR); and
- Body fluids are contained by secure, occlusive dressing(s) or drainage collection system(s).

## MEALS AND EATING UTENSILS
- There are no restrictions on group dining, however the resident should wash their hands prior to going to the dining room.
- Use regular dishes and cutlery. Disposable dishes are not necessary. Normal procedures for washing and sanitizing dishes are to be used.

## BATHING
- Can be conducted as per regular bathing schedule.
- Ensure the tub/shower, shower chair, and/or any other bathing/showering equipment/item is cleaned and disinfected after each use.

## VISITORS AND VOLUNTEERS
- Ensure visitors and volunteers:
- wash their hands before entering and before leaving the resident’s room; and
- are aware of precautions in place and proper hand hygiene techniques.

## DISCONTINUATION OF PRECAUTIONS
- A urine sample must be taken after antibiotic treatment. Contact Precautions can be discontinued after a sample comes back negative.

# About VRE

## VANCOMYCIN RESISTANT ENTEROCOCCI

### What is VRE?
Enterococci are bacteria normally found in the human bowel and genital tract. Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci (VRE) is a type of bacteria which has become resistant to many antibiotics including Vancomycin.

### Mode of VRE Transmission
The single most important mode of transmission of VRE in a healthcare setting is via transiently colonized hands of the healthcare worker who acquire it from contact with colonized or infected residents or after handling contaminated material or equipment. VRE transmission via environmental sources includes:

- Most items in the healthcare environment including blood pressure cuffs, electronic thermometers, monitoring devices, stethoscopes, call bells, and bed rails;
- Contamination of the environment with VRE when the resident has diarrhea, fecal incontinence, or uncontained draining wounds.

### Risk Factors for VRE Transmission
Risk Factors for VRE include:

- Previous antibiotic therapy;
- Multiple antibiotic therapy;
- Vancomycin therapy;
- Prior colonization with VRE;
- Prior C. diff (Clostridioides difficile) infection;
- Indwelling Foley catheters;
- Central venous catheterization;
- Renal insufficiency; and
- Increased duration of hospital stays.
```

# How to Decrease the Risk of VRE Transmission

The risk of transmission of VRE can be reduced by following routine practices including strict compliance with hand hygiene and Contact Precautions. It is also especially important for residents, visitors, families, and volunteers to perform hand hygiene.

## VRE IPAC Precautions

### SCREENING

All residents must be screened for any ARO upon admission or after 12 or more hours stay in a hospital. Screen residents following the Multi-Drug Resistant Organism (MDRO) Screening Algorithm (in the IPAC Manual). VRE requires a rectal swab or a stool specimen (preferred). If taking a swab, it should be a peri-anal swab taken with a routine culture and sensitivity swab. Additional specimen/swabs must be taken of catheterized urine from an indwelling catheter or open wounds on the body and sent at the same time.

If testing is required and a resident has tested positive:
- Initiate contact precautions.
- Subsequently, specimens are to be collected at one-week intervals until three (3) weekly specimens have been collected.
- If the resident is still found to be positive for VRE, retest in three months.

Once a resident has one VRE negative stool or rectal swab culture, then two more consecutive negative specimens must be obtained one week apart. This also applies if the resident has VRE isolated from the urine or a wound.

**Note:** Refer to province/area-specific directives as screening procedures may differ.

### ROOM PLACEMENT

A single/private room with individual toileting facilities is preferable. The use of a private room with a private bathroom is essential for VRE positive individuals who have diarrhea, fecal incontinence, an ileostomy or colostomy, and/or open wounds. When a private room is not available, a resident who has VRE may share a room with another resident with VRE (cohorting). Refer to the Bathrooms section for commode procedures and precautions.

```markdown
# VRE IPAC Precautions

## BATHROOMS
- Separate toilet, washing or bathing facilities are essential.
- Residents must have their own towels and toiletries, which must not be shared with others.
- If cohorting, designate a commode to the VRE positive resident:
- Use commodes with buckets; do not place the commode over the toilet;
- The commode and toilet are to be cleaned and disinfected after each emptying;
- The toilet is considered VRE contaminated and thus a source of infection.

## COMMUNICATION OF PRECAUTIONS
- Routine practices (i.e., proper hand hygiene technique and practices) and contact precautionary measures must be communicated to anyone (e.g., healthcare workers, volunteers, family and visitors) entering the resident’s room using Extendicare’s Contact Precautionary signage or as provincially mandated.
- Must include notations on the resident’s chart and care plan necessary to alert staff to the need for precautions in addition to basic infection control practices.

## MEDICAL TRANSPORT
- When transferring a resident with VRE, notify the receiving healthcare facility or setting and the transport personnel of the resident’s VRE status prior to transfer. Prior to transferring:
- Have the resident perform hand hygiene on leaving his/her room for transfer.
- The resident must have any open wounds/lesions covered.
- Ensure the resident is wearing apparel (i.e., clothes, housecoat or cover gown).

## EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
- Blood pressure cuffs, stethoscopes, thermometers, pulse oximeters, commodes, walkers, wheelchairs and transfer slings etc. should be dedicated to the resident/resident room whenever possible. These items are to be cleaned and disinfected after the resident is discharged or taken off additional precautions.
- Shared between residents (e.g., shower chair, bathtub, mechanical lifts) must be cleaned and disinfected after each use.

## LAUNDRY
- Treat the resident’s linen as isolation linen; the policy and procedure for handling isolation linen must be followed (refer to policy, Processing Isolation Linen in the Housekeeping and Laundry Services Manual).

## HOUSEKEEPING
- Every item inside the resident’s room is considered contaminated.
- If the resident is asymptomatic there is no need to change daily cleaning practices.
- If the resident is symptomatic or the home is in outbreak, daily cleaning must be done.
- Ensure contact time per manufacturer’s directions is followed for all chemicals.
- Gloves and gowns must be worn.

# About MRSA

## METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS

### What is MRSA?
Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a type of bacteria that is commonly found on the skin and in the noses of healthy individuals. Some Staph bacteria are easily treated while others are not. Staph bacteria that are resistant to several antibiotics, such as Methicillin, are known as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA. Some infections caused by S. aureus include:

- cellulitis
- pustules
- carbuncles
- impetigo
- bacteremia
- endocarditis
- wound infections
- less commonly pneumonia

Pus or drainage from lesions or any other body substances containing the organism are potentially infectious.

S. aureus is transmitted primarily through direct person-to-person contact, especially through the hands of healthcare workers. Nasal carriage of S. aureus is very common and may be due to hand-to-nose transmission. A nasal carrier often contaminates his/her own hands by hands-to-nose contact and then transmits the organism during routine activities. Since skin-to-skin contact is the most significant mode of transmission, hand hygiene is of primary importance in preventing the spread of MRSA.

### Mode of MRSA Transmission
The primary mechanism for transmission of MRSA from one resident to another is via healthcare workers whose hands have become transiently colonized. Hands may become contaminated after direct contact with colonized or infected residents while performing resident care, when removing gloves, or touching contaminated surfaces. On occasion, residents may acquire MRSA from direct contact with contaminated surfaces.

### How to Decrease the Risk of MRSA Transmission
The risk of transmission of MRSA can be reduced by following routine practices including strict compliance with hand hygiene and contact precautions. It is also very important for residents, visitors, families, and volunteers to perform hand hygiene.

```markdown
# Assessing Risk of Transmission

Precautions used to decrease transmission of MRSA must be balanced with promoting a home-like environment for residents. The risk of transmission will be significantly reduced if healthcare workers consistently perform routine practices including hand hygiene. In addition to routine practices, contact precautions should be implemented for those residents with the following conditions:

- Extensive desquamating skin disorder with known or suspected MRSA infection or significant colonization.
- Infected wounds in which drainage cannot be contained by a dressing.
- Colonized tracheostomy or pneumonia with uncontrolled respiratory secretions.

## Higher Risk of Transmission

- Draining skin lesions or wounds not covered by dressings
- Respiratory secretions (uncontrolled)
- Resident requiring extensive hands-on care
- Resident has invasive devices
- Poor compliance with hygienic practices and infection control precautions, e.g., confused resident
- Incontinence of stool or urine (not contained)
- Exfoliating skin conditions

## Lower Risk of Transmission

- Skin lesions or wounds covered by dressing
- Able to control respiratory secretions
- Capable of self-care
- Good hygiene
- Compliant with infection control precautions
- Continent

## MRSA Characteristics that Promote Transmission

- Spread by contact
- Able to survive in the environment
- Able to colonize invasive devices
- Propensity for asymptomatic/carrier state
- Inadequate housekeeping
- Shared resident equipment without cleaning between residents (e.g., thermometer bases, commodes)
- Crowded facilities
- Shared facilities (e.g., rooms, toilets, bath, sinks)

## Environment

- High resident-nurse ratio
- Requiring extensive hands-on care
- Have invasive procedures or devices
- Non-intact skin
- Exfoliating skin conditions
- Debilitated, severe underlying disease
- Extremes of age
- Recent antibiotic therapy

## Host Resident

- Immunosuppression

# MRSA IPAC Precautions

## SCREENING
- All residents must be screened for any ARO upon admission or after 12 or more hours stay in a hospital. Screen residents following Multi-Drug Resistant Organism (MDRO) Screening Algorithm (in the IPAC Manual).
- Test a minimum of two areas including anterior nares and rectum (peri-anal) and one of the following, if indicated:
- Skin lesions/open wounds (including surgical incision);
- Invasive device sites (e.g., intravenous lines, feeding tubes or tracheostomies);
- A urine specimen may be sent if a urinary catheter is present; or
- Screening on previous positives or re-screening.
- Once a resident has cultured positive for MRSA, contact precautions must be initiated unless otherwise directed by the local public health authority. Swabs should be initiated 48 hours after completion of antibiotic therapy for any infection.

## ROOM PLACEMENT
- A single/private room with individual toileting facilities is preferable.
- When a private room is not available, a resident who has MRSA may share a room with another resident with MRSA (cohorting) but with no other infection or share with a roommate who is at low risk for MRSA acquisition or infection. Characteristics of a low risk roommate include:
- Free of open wounds (surgical incisions or decubitus ulcers);
- Free of invasive devices (urinary catheters, IV, gastrostomy tubes or tracheotomies); and
- Not debilitated or bed-bound requiring extensive hands-on care.
- MRSA precautions must be maintained with each resident (follow local public health direction). In a shared bedroom, PPE must be changed between each resident when providing care even if both residents have MRSA.

## BATHROOMS
- Separate toilet, washing or bathing facilities are preferable.
- Residents must have their own towels and toiletries, which must not be shared with others.

## COMMUNICATION OF PRECAUTIONS
- Routine practices (i.e., proper hand hygiene technique and practices) and contact precautionary measures must be communicated to anyone (e.g., healthcare workers, volunteers, family and visitors) entering the resident’s room using Extendicare’s Contact Precautions poster, or as provincially mandated.
- Must include notations on the resident’s chart and care plan necessary to alert staff to the need for additional precautions in addition to routine practices.
- Will be shared with the receiving provider and/or ambulance staff if the resident requires transfer.

# MRSA IPAC Precautions

## EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
- Blood pressure cuffs, stethoscopes, thermometers, pulse oximeters, etc. should be dedicated to the resident/resident room.
- If this is not possible, the care equipment must be cleaned and disinfected after each use. These items are to be cleaned and disinfected after the resident is discharged or taken off the precautions.
- Shared equipment between residents (e.g., shower chair, bathtub, commode, mechanical lifts) must be cleaned and disinfected after each use. Care equipment that cannot be easily cleaned or disinfected (e.g., transfer sling) must be dedicated to the individual.
- Disposable, sterile trays must be used for dressings; catheterization, and equipment discarded after use.
- Dedicated bedpans and urinals must be used and cleaned and disinfected after each use.

## LAUNDRY
- If the resident is symptomatic, treat resident’s linen as isolation linen, and the policy and procedure for handling isolation linen must be followed (refer to policy, Processing Isolation Linen in the Housekeeping and Laundry Services Manual).

## HOUSEKEEPING
- Use Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide (AHP) disinfectant. All surfaces are to be cleaned twice. The first time to remove organic soil and the second to disinfect. Ensure contact time per manufacturer’s directions is followed for all chemicals.
- Routine terminal cleaning, using AHP, when precautions are discontinued, or the resident is transferred or discharged as per policy/procedure is required. Clean surfaces twice, changing cleaning cloths frequently between each task (surface).
- Follow the policy, Isolation Room Cleaning in the Housekeeping and Laundry Services Manual.

## RESIDENT ACTIVITIES
- Resident participation in the home’s activities should not be restricted unless body fluids cannot be contained. Resident may leave the room if:
- Contamination of the environment is unlikely, as assessed.
- They perform (or are assisted with) proper hand washing or hand rubbing with an alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR); and
- Body fluids are contained by secure, occlusive dressing(s) or drainage collection system(s).

## MEALS AND EATING UTENSILS
- Regular dishes and cutlery may be used, disposable dishes are not required.
- If the resident goes to the common dining room, ensure that the resident’s hands are washed prior to entering.
- May participate in regular meal activities.

## BATHING
- Can be conducted as per regular bathing schedule.

# MRSA IPAC Precautions

## VISITORS AND VOLUNTEERS
- Ensure visitors and volunteers:
- wash their hands before entering and before leaving the resident’s room; and
- are aware of precautions in place and proper hand hygiene techniques.

## DISCONTINUATION OF PRECAUTIONS
- Contact precautions may be discontinued after at least 3 consecutive negative specimens are obtained one week apart, or as directed by the local public health authority.

## MEDICAL TRANSPORT
- When transferring a resident with MRSA, notify the receiving healthcare facility or setting and the transport personnel of the resident’s MRSA status prior to transfer. Prior to transferring:
- Have the resident perform hand hygiene on leaving his/her room for transfer.
- The resident must have any open wounds/lesions covered.
- Ensure the resident is wearing apparel (i.e., clothes, housecoat or cover gown).

## DECOLONIZATION
- Decolonization therapy refers to topical and/or systematic antimicrobial treatment administered for the purpose of eradicating MRSA carriage from the skin, nose or other mucosal surfaces.
- Routine decolonization is not recommended because:
- It is not demonstrated to be consistently effective as the ability of topical and/or systemic therapy to eradicate MRSA may vary depending on the situation (e.g., wounds, presence of indwelling catheters);
- There is the potential for serious adverse events from the use of the therapy; and
- Antimicrobial resistance can develop because of decolonization therapy.
- Decolonization may be recommended for:
- Control of outbreaks;
- Recurrent MRSA infection after appropriate treatment; and
- Pre-operatively to reduce the risk of peri-operative infections.
```

```markdown
# Glossary of Terms

## ADDITIONAL PRECAUTIONS
These precautions include contact precautions in addition to routine practices. Droplet precautions are also used with symptomatic patients who are nasally colonized with MRSA.

## AHP
**AHP:** Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide. AHP is a patented synergistic blend of commonly used ingredients that when combined with low levels of hydrogen peroxide dramatically increase its germicidal potency and cleaning performance.

## ALCOHOL-BASED HAND RUB
**Alcohol-based hand rub:** Alcohol preparations with 70%-90% alcohol with added emollients to reduce skin irritation. These preparations are less time-consuming to use than washing with soap and water and are intended to kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms on the skin.

## CARRIER
**Carrier:** An individual who is found to be persistently culture positive (colonized), but who has no signs or symptoms of infection. The Carrier State can persist for an indefinite period, during which the carrier may transmit the organism to other individuals.

## COHORTING
**Cohorting:** Two or more residents colonized or infected with the same organism placed/roomed together to minimize their contact with other unaffected residents on the same unit.

## CONTAMINATION
**Contamination:** The presence of microorganisms on inanimate objects (e.g., clothing, forceps) or microorganisms transported transiently on body surfaces such as hands, or in substances (e.g., water, food, milk). The introduction of microorganisms into a clean or sterile area (e.g., open wound).

## DECOLONIZATION
**Decolonization:** The treatment regime used to attempt elimination of microorganism carriage or colonization using antimicrobial soap, topical and/or systemic antibiotics.

## DISCHARGE/TRANSFER/TERMINAL CLEANING
**Discharge/Transfer/Terminal Cleaning:** The thorough cleaning of a resident’s room or bed space following discharge, death, or transfer of the resident to remove contaminating microorganisms that might be acquired by subsequent occupants and/or staff.

## DISINFECTION
**Disinfection:** The inactivation of disease-producing microorganisms. Disinfection does not destroy bacterial spores. Medical equipment/devices must be cleaned thoroughly before effective disinfection can take place.
```

# Hand Hygiene

A general term referring to any action of hand cleaning. Hand hygiene relates to the removal of visible soil and removal or killing of transient microorganisms from the hands. Hand hygiene may be accomplished by using an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and running water.

## Definitions

- **NARES**: Plural of naris which is the external opening into the nasal cavity.
- **NASAL CARRIAGE**: Anterior nares are persistently colonized with a microorganism.
- **RESIDENT**: An individual who resides in a long-term care home.
- **ROUTINE PRECAUTIONS**: The system of infection prevention and control practices recommended by Public Health Agency of Canada to be used with all residents during all care to prevent and control transmission of micro-organisms in a healthcare setting.
- **INFECTION**: The entry and multiplication of a microorganism in an individual’s tissue(s) causing cellular injury. Signs and symptoms of infection include but are not limited to fever, increased white blood cell count, purulence, and inflammation.
- **IPAC HOME LEAD**: Manages, oversees and serves as a role model to promote the goals of the IPAC program in the home. Also known as IPAC Manager, ICSA, IPAC Coordinator, etc.
- **MULTI-DRUG RESISTANT ORGANISMS (MDRO)**: Microorganisms that have developed resistance to the action of several antimicrobial agents and are of special clinical or epidemiologic significance.
- **SCREENING**: A process to identify residents at risk of being colonized with antibiotic-resistant organisms and, if risk factors are identified, obtaining appropriate specimens.
- **RISK FACTORS**: Poor functional status, prior antibiotic therapy, open wounds or decubitus ulcers, urinary catheters, and feeding tubes.
- **TRANSIENT COLONIZATION**: The temporary colonization of skin when in contact with individuals who are infected or colonized with a microorganism.
