# BACKGROUND

## What is Legionella?
Legionella is a type of bacteria that is normally found in freshwater environments such as lakes and streams, but the low amounts in freshwater do not lead to disease. Legionella can become a health problem in building water systems because they often provide the means for Legionella to reproduce, increase in numbers, and contaminate the building’s water system.

When Legionella is aerosolized and inhaled by high-risk individuals (such as residents, immunocompromised individuals, asthmatic staff, etc.), it can cause a type of pneumonia called Legionnaires’ disease, which may lead to severe illness and death.

## What is a Water Safety Plan (WSP)?
A Water Safety Plan (WSP) is one of the best ways to mitigate the risk of water system contamination by Legionella species. Water contamination can occur between the delivery of water (e.g., municipal supply) and consumption/use (e.g., resident sink/shower/etc.).

The home’s water system can become contaminated due to several reasons. Stagnant water (e.g., dead legs, unused faucets, etc.) can allow biofilm to form in the water system. Legionellae live and reproduce within biofilm. Biofilms can act as constant sources of contamination and are difficult to eliminate once established in the water system.

Construction, water main breaks, and changes in municipal water quality can contribute to contaminating the home’s water system by encouraging the growth of Legionella.

The World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Ontario Ministries of Health and Long-Term Care (MOH and MLTC) recommend water safety plans for all LTCs. The WSP guides the home to monitor the water system and immediately respond to any risks. The WSP includes a sampling plan, acceptable Legionella limits, and recommendations on how to respond.

# PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE
```

```markdown
# Routine Water System Maintenance Policy

Routine water system maintenance is vital in providing a safe water source for residents and staff. Following the manufacturer’s guidelines for preventative maintenance of each component is a minimum requirement and is a proactive approach to ensure that the water system components continue to work as intended and prevent possible contamination by Legionella due to faulty machinery (e.g., water tanks can lose their ability to heat water properly if not maintained according to the manufacturer’s instructions).

## Components of a Typical Water System

Components of a typical water system can include the following examples:
- Water tanks and water heaters
- Faucets and fixtures
- Ice machines
- Fountains
- Bathtubs
- Pipes
- Valves
- Cooling towers
- Humidifiers (whether personal or central)
- Eyewash stations
- Medical devices (e.g., CPAP & BiPAP machines)

## Preventative Maintenance Record

Use the template below to record the preventative maintenance required for the water system's components. An example is included in the first row.

| Component                | Action        | Frequency |
|-------------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Example: Cooling Tower  | Filter Change | Annually  |

# COMMON RISK FACTORS

In addition to routine maintenance of the water system, it is also important to recognize common risk factors that could increase the likelihood of Legionella spreading in the water system. Understanding and mitigating such risk factors will help maintain a safer water system for residents and staff. There should be collaboration between the home’s maintenance department, clinical staff, management, and corporate consultants (e.g., Engineering, and IPAC) to identify and eliminate those risk factors.

## External Risk Factors

| Risk Factor          | Reason                                  | Suggested Mitigation                                           |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Construction        | Vibration and changes in water pressure can dislodge biofilm, where Legionella lives, freeing Legionella into the water system. | Identify areas that will be affected by construction and plan a flushing schedule for sinks/fixtures in that area. Also, protect sinks/fixtures in the area (e.g., covering them). |
| Water Main Breaks   | Changes in water pressure can dislodge biofilm and free Legionella into the water system. Also, dirt and debris can be introduced into the water system. | Flush the water at multiple sinks/fixtures near the entry point of the water, and in areas where water discoloration/odor is observed. |
| Change in municipal water quality | Changes in water quality can increase sediment, lower disinfectant levels, or cause pH to be outside recommended ranges. | Follow municipal guidelines (e.g., boil water advisory) and coordinate with the local public health authority. |

## Internal Risk Factors

| Risk Factor          | Reason                                  | Suggested Mitigation                                           |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Biofilm              | Protects Legionella from heat and disinfectant, and provides food and shelter. | If biofilm is visible, clean with detergent/remove the affected fixture. Plan flushing schedule to prevent biofilm from forming in the pipes (e.g., flushing of sinks/fixtures on multiple floors). |
| Scale and sediment   | Uses up disinfectant and shields Legionella. | Constant flushing of sinks/fixtures (e.g., for 10 minutes daily). |
```

# Legionella from Disinfectants

## Water Stagnation
Changes in water quality can increase sediment, lower disinfectant levels, or cause pH to be outside recommended ranges.

- **Removing any dead legs in the building.**
- **Daily flushing** (e.g., for 10 minutes) of sinks/fixtures that are not used often in the home.

## SAMPLING PLAN

### Legionella Investigation
When there is a suspected Legionella case that might be linked to the home, the local Public Health Authority would typically launch an investigation which includes sampling different water sources in the home to determine if there is a link to the home or not. Water sources that are typically investigated include fixtures (e.g., sinks and faucets) in the suspected resident’s room, and other sources (e.g., communal shower, water tanks, fountains) as determined by the Public Health Authority. If the source of Legionella was established to be in the home, it will be considered a Legionella-positive resident.

> **Note:** If there is a Legionella case that is being investigated, reach out to the Corporate IPAC Consultants for recommendations and support.

Once the investigation establishes a link between the home and the Legionella-positive resident, the Public Health Authority typically recommends next steps for remediation, such as:

- Flushing of the water system
- Changing of the affected fixtures
- Drainage of the water tank
- Other measures, as necessary

After the remediation has been completed, the home should establish a water Sampling Plan to constantly monitor the safety of their water system and prevent future Legionella infections.

A Sampling Plan is a key component of the Water Safety Plan (WSP), especially if there is a confirmed Legionella case linked to the home. The Sampling Plan will begin with the fixtures within the affected resident’s room, adjacent rooms, and communal shower/spa spaces used by the confirmed case. Further site sampling will be determined based on analysis in collaboration with your IPAC Consultant.

Most Public Health Authorities do not perform routine environmental sampling of Legionella unless a case of Legionella-positive resident or staff was being investigated. In addition, Public Health Laboratories do not process any environmental samples that are not related to a Legionella-positive case (i.e., the Sampling Plan cannot be done by the Public Health Authority).

Homes should outsource their sampling to certified professionals (e.g., Environmental Hygienists) who are trained on environmental sampling for Legionella and who are also able to process the collected sample (either through their own laboratory or through a certified third-party laboratory). The laboratory must be certified in testing for Legionella and is able to quantify (i.e., provide numerical values) their results to determine the number of colony-forming units per liter (cfu/L) or per milliliter (cfu/mL) detected.

# Sampling Procedure

According to the Sampling Plan, both Microbiological Testing and Parameter Testing are included.

## Microbiological Testing
- **Tests for Legionella species** in the collected water sample. This can be done using PCR and/or culture.

## Parameter Testing
- **Tests for water parameters** to determine whether the conditions support the growth of Legionella. Parameters that are often tested are disinfectant levels (i.e., residual chlorine) and water temperature.

## Sample Collection Methods
Samples are collected in two ways (i.e., Sample Type):
- **Bulk Water** – capture the free-floating Legionella or any disturbed biofilm.
- **Biofilm Swab** - capture Legionella contained within a biofilm.

**Note:** PH Laboratories do not process any environmental samples that are not related to a Legionella-positive case.

Samples must be collected in an aseptic manner using sterile containers to avoid contaminating the collected sample, resulting in false positive results.

**Note:** Colony forming units (cfu) are a standard measure that is used to quantify the number of microorganisms in a sample.

## Home-Specific Sampling Plan
Sampling frequency is quarterly if any of the following apply:
- The home has had a confirmed Legionella case in the past 12 months.
- If the home is at increased risk for Legionella, such as major water disruptions and using well water.

**Note:** If any of the conditions mentioned above are met, reach out to the Corporate IPAC Consultants team for advice on next steps.

### Sampling Plan Template
The table below is a template for a Sampling Plan. It provides recommendations on locations that are best suited to collect samples from the home’s water system.

| Location          | Recommended Action          |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| Example Location  | Collect sample              |
| Another Location  | Monitor regularly           |

# ACTION LEVELS

Cultures are best for detecting Legionella and may help determine the levels (colony-forming units/litre - cfu/L) of viable Legionella in the collected samples. Below are some suggested action levels that can be adopted by the home, and the responses to such action levels.

| Legionella Count (cfu/L) | Action(s)                                                                                     |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Not detected              | No interventions necessary; routine monitoring will continue as pre-determined by the Sample Plan. |
| <100 cfu/L               |                                                                                               |
| >100 cfu/L               | If two or fewer culture results are positive, then the WSP will be revised by the home, including the possibility of additional control measures. |
| <1000 cfu/L              | If three or more culture results are positive, then remediation measures will be evaluated in addition to additional control measures. |
| >1000 cfu/L              | Immediate remediation measures will be taken to address the elevated levels of Legionella. Increased testing of the affected areas should be considered after remediation is completed. |

# REMEDIATION MEASURES

When an action level (based on the table above) is reached, the home should consult first with the Corporate Consultant Team (e.g., Engineering, IPAC, Environmental, Nursing, Occ. H&S, etc.) prior to implementing any remediation measures. Remediation measures can include any of the following:

1. Superheating (e.g., superheating of water tank)
2. Drainage of stored water (e.g., complete drainage of the water tank)
3. Flushing of the water system for at least 10 minutes
4. Replacement of contaminated fixtures (e.g., faucets) and/or devices (e.g., humidifier)

Each of the remediation measures above has its advantages and disadvantages. The home should collaborate with the Corporate Consultant Team and other professionals before implementing any remediation measures.
