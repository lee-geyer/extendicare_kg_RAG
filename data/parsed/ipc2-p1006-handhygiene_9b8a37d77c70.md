## POLICY

### Infection Prevention

## PROCEDURE

Hand hygiene is the single most effective way to prevent the spread of infection.

- Post procedural reminders above public hand hygiene stations and hand washing areas/sinks and common areas, such as the entrance/exit doors.
- All employees will:
- Use alcohol-based hand rubs with an alcohol concentration of 70% or greater.
- Use alcohol-based hand rub as the preferred method of hand hygiene when hands are not visibly soiled.
- Perform hand hygiene at the point of care during the 4 Moments of Hand Hygiene and before, between and after activities that may result in cross contamination.
- Hand hygiene using soap and water is preferred:
- When hands are visibly soiled.
- After caring for a resident with Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) or Norovirus infection, at the point of care.
- In exceptional circumstances, use a moist towel/wipe followed by alcohol-based hand rub when hands are visibly soiled and access to hand washing facilities is limited and/or when water is unavailable.
- Ensure frequently missed areas (e.g., thumbs, palms, web spaces, under nails, backs of fingers and hands) are cleaned when performing hand hygiene.
- Use supplied lotions that are compatible with hand hygiene products and gloves.
- Avoid touching contaminated surfaces or objects after performing hand hygiene.
- All employees will:
- Not wear artificial nails or nail enhancements, gel nails or extenders. Nail polish, if worn, must be fresh and free of cracks or chips. Nail polish that is chipped can harbour microorganisms.
- Keep natural fingernails short (no longer than ¼” or 0.635 cm long).
- Reduce/remove hand and wrist jewelry.
- Wall mount and stand-alone point of use hand sanitizer stations will be located according to environmental scan [Refer to Locations for Hand Sanitizer Stations]. The home will be responsible for the management of all hand hygiene dispensers (in good working order, product expiry dates monitored and reporting of defects).
