# Extendicare Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) Assessment Algorithm

## I think the resident may have a UTI
**Stop. Assess resident**

### Does resident have:
#### Clinical Signs & Symptoms of a UTI
- Resident has new difficult or painful urination (Acute dysuria)
- Or
- Two or more of the following:
- Fever (Oral temperature greater than 37.9°C or 1.5°C above baseline on 2 consecutive occasions within 12 hours)
- New flank pain or suprapubic pain or tenderness
- New or increased urinary frequency, urgency
- Gross Hematuria
- Acute onset of delirium in residents with advanced dementia*

#### OR Non-specific symptoms only
- Worsening functional status
- Worsening mental status (e.g., new behavioural changes, increased confusion, acute delirium or agitation)

**Notes:**
- Behavioural changes on their own do not indicate a UTI unless clinical symptoms develop (see box above):
- Falls should not be considered a presentation of infection.

### Encourage and Monitor, Assess, and Discuss
1. Encourage and monitor increased fluid intake for the next 24 hours, unless resident has clinical contraindications.
2. Assess for constipation and other causes of behaviour change.
3. Discuss with physician or nurse practitioner.
4. Obtain urine culture. If empiric antibiotics are prescribed, collect urine specimen for culture and susceptibility before antibiotic therapy is initiated. Urine specimen can be obtained as a mid-stream or in/out catheter specimen.

### Reassess for UTI signs and symptoms after 24 hours
#### Review urine culture results:
- Bacterial count greater than 10⁸ CFU/L, with signs and symptoms is compatible with UTI.
- More than two (2) different organisms indicates contamination.

#### Consult with the resident’s physician or nurse practitioner (NP) about the urine culture results and the resident’s status.
- Yes: UTI symptoms develop
- No:
- No urine culture required.
- No UTI treatment required.
- Assess further regarding cause of non-specific symptoms.

### Antibiotic therapy
Physician or NP should reassess antibiotic therapy based on:
- Treatment need
- Antimicrobial susceptibility
- Route of administration
- Prescribed duration
