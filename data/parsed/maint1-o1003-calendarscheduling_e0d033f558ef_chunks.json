Routine activities depend on the specific characteristics of the physical plant, the type of equipment, and any specific responsibilities as detailed in the Job Descriptions in effect. Once the individual checklists for the key equipment and systems have been developed, the Maintenance Department shall develop a daily work routine and a Monthly Calendar to schedule essential routine activities.",

Once the individual checklists for the key equipment and systems have been developed, the Maintenance Department shall develop a daily work routine and a Monthly Calendar to schedule essential routine activities. A sample of a blank monthly calendar is available as a Tool named “Monthly Maintenance Calendar”.- When setting up a monthly calendar, it is advised to schedule little or, if possible, no work on Mondays or Fridays, since these days are frequently filled with non-routine or emergency work.- The work from all of the maintenance task lists should be relatively evenly distributed across the remaining work-days of the month. Some tasks can be done relatively quickly, while others can take much more time. Evenly distributing the work does not mean having the same number of tasks each day, but rather having tasks that require, in total, the same amount of time each day.- It is also advisable to try to group similar tasks together.",

Evenly distributing the work does not mean having the same number of tasks each day, but rather having tasks that require, in total, the same amount of time each day.- It is also advisable to try to group similar tasks together. For example, several kitchen maintenance items should be scheduled for the same day, since that work may need to be done after hours when the kitchen is not being used; various tasks to complete on the roof may be scheduled for the same day, since tools, filters, etc. will be transported to the roof to do this work.- It is very important to realize that the monthly calendar is a guide and not a fixed schedule. There are many events that can occur to prevent a fixed schedule from being followed. Examples of some typical distractions are:\n- vacations\n- sickness\n- problems within the home such as outbreak\n- visits from government inspectors, accreditation agencies, etc.- If an event occurs that prevents scheduled maintenance from taking place on the day listed, then that maintenance should be carried out on some other day of the month when it is convenient.",

If a particular preventive maintenance task cannot be completed in any one month, it can be deferred to the next month, provided that task is not avoided two months in a row.----**Helping people live better**\nThis document is uncontrolled when printed.
