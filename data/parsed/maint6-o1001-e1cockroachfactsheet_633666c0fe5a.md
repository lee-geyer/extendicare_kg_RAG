# Extendicare Cockroach Fact Sheet

## Types of Cockroaches
Cockroaches in Canada measure between 1 to 5 centimeters in length and range in color from black to reddish-brown. They have a long antenna and six legs, which are long and spiny. The body is flattened back to front and oval-shaped, making them perfectly equipped to hide in small cracks and crevices that touch both the topside and underside of the body. Cockroach droppings vary in size according to species and can produce droppings the size of coffee grounds to small smears on walls and baseboards. Cockroaches are nocturnal, so they hide during the day and are active at night. They move rapidly when exposed and can easily move from one room to another.

**Note:** Cockroaches lay a lot of eggs, so an infestation can happen rapidly. It’s important to be **PROACTIVE** to prevent this from happening.

## What do Cockroaches Feed On?
Cockroaches are highly adaptable and can live wherever enough food, moisture, and heat exist to support them. They regularly enter buildings where humans live to look for a warm, damp environment in close proximity to sources of food and water. Ideal habitats for these pests include basements, bathrooms, kitchens, and rooms containing sewer pipes or plumbing. They are scavengers and look for food in a variety of sources. Indoors, roaches live on food left by humans. They will eat everything, including glue, leather, fabric, soap, toothpaste, and common pantry items. Starchy or sugary substances tend to attract cockroaches.

## Can Someone Get Sick or Ill from Cockroaches?
Cockroaches create an unsanitary situation and can pose various health threats to humans. Eating food contaminated by cockroaches may cause food poisoning. Their feces can also negatively affect the health of humans, particularly for people with asthma. They can spread harmful bacteria, such as coliform, salmonella, and Staphylococcus, by crawling through garbage and sewers to kitchen countertops.

## How Do Cockroaches Get into the Home?
Cockroaches can get into a home on objects such as furniture, supplies, and equipment. They can be brought into the home by deliveries of supplies, equipment, and food. Staff, visitors, and new residents can bring them in on objects such as their personal belongings.

## What Can I Do If I See Evidence of Cockroaches in the Home?
Call your Pest Control immediately. Try to capture a sample using a sealed container to show the pest control company. The pest control company will identify the type of cockroach, and based on the results, will determine the type of treatment necessary to treat the areas. Ensure that the Pest Control company schedules additional visits until the situation is under control or eliminated.
