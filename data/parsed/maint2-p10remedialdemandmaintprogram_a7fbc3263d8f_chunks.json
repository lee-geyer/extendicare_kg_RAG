This policy establishes a requirement for a program that provides remedial maintenance for the building and for the equipment and systems that are part of the building.### STANDARD\n- All homes shall have a remedial (demand) maintenance program that provides a system of routine inspections and repairs to the building components including the equipment and systems that are part of the building. This shall include but not be limited to:\n- Electrical and non-electrical equipment\n- Mechanical lifts\n- Plumbing fixtures, washroom fixtures, toilets, sinks and grab-bars\n- Temperature of hot water serving bathtubs, showers and hand basins used by residents\n- Mechanical ventilation systems.\n- The Maintenance Manager/Lead will develop a program to provide remedial maintenance to equipment and systems.\n- When a piece of equipment presents a hazard to workers, it will be \"locked out\" until it is repaired. All staff will be informed of this procedure for any equipment requiring repair.## PROCEDURE",
