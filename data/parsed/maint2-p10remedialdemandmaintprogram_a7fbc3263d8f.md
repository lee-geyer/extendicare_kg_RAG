## POLICY
An important part of this type of maintenance is the development of a system that advises maintenance workers of the need to effect repairs. This policy establishes a requirement for a program that provides remedial maintenance for the building and for the equipment and systems that are part of the building.

### STANDARD
- All homes shall have a remedial (demand) maintenance program that provides a system of routine inspections and repairs to the building components including the equipment and systems that are part of the building. This shall include but not be limited to:
- Electrical and non-electrical equipment
- Mechanical lifts
- Plumbing fixtures, washroom fixtures, toilets, sinks and grab-bars
- Temperature of hot water serving bathtubs, showers and hand basins used by residents
- Mechanical ventilation systems.
- The Maintenance Manager/Lead will develop a program to provide remedial maintenance to equipment and systems.
- When a piece of equipment presents a hazard to workers, it will be "locked out" until it is repaired. All staff will be informed of this procedure for any equipment requiring repair.
