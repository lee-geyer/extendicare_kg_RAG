A business continuity plan is a mixture of integrated systems and plans that enable a business to prevent and recover from threats. The purpose of the Business Continuity (BCP) is to ensure timely and orderly continuation or resumption of key operations when our home and our residents are impacted by unplanned or unanticipated incidents or events. This plan will be utilized upon anticipated or actual loss of access to critical resources required for service delivery and/or an absenteeism rate of >33% of employees for a period of 1 day or greater.

Most are of a local nature and result in short-term business continuity disruptions. They are primarily notable in that they restrict employees' access to key resources such as their workplace (to conduct ongoing business), their information systems (to process or retrieve critical data), or people (to coordinate an effective and timely response).During an emergency or disaster situation, Extendicare will work in cooperation with the Region’s Emergency Services/Emergency Control Group and the City Fire Department and Corporate Office supports. The IT Business Continuity Plan and Pandemic Plan are also part of Extendicare’s business continuity planning. As per the Extendicare Emergency Preparedness and Management Manual, “Emergency Plans” policy, each home is to have a home-specific Emergency Response Plan (ERP) and Fire Safety Plan. These plans will comprehensively state the actions the home will take when faced with an emergency.To complete this plan, each home conducts a Hazard Identification and Risk Analysis (HIRA) (see Procedure and Tool Hazard Identification and Risk Analysis attached to policy 1) to determine the most likely disasters or threats to the home. The ERP is then based on these threats and must also meet all provincial and national Fire Codes and IMS emergency response standards.This home-specific ERP must include:",
