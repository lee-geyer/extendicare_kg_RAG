## POLICY
### Personal Clothing and Linen Processes

## PROCEDURE

### Manager or Designate:
- Using the sample in Tools – Laundry Drying Times, develop drying times and temperatures for each dryer in the home and post the standards for staff to follow.
- **Note:** Drying times may differ depending on size, model, and age of equipment. Ensure a cool-down cycle is always included.
- Work with the Maintenance Department to ensure, wherever possible, dryer settings are set at 120ºF, 140ºF, and 160ºF with a cut-off of 180ºF.
- If procedures for filling dryers are not being followed, review loading practices with staff.

### Laundry Staff:
- Empty clean linen from washers into designated clean linen bins and transport to dryers.
- Load the dryers based on the type of linens being processed so that linens can tumble freely.
- Take note of the following:
- Dryers take about 60 to 70% of their rated capacity in weight. Therefore, if you had 50 lbs of wet linen for a 50 lb dryer you would put about ¾ of the load in the machine.
- A 75 lb dryer will accommodate a full load of a 50 lb washer. Fast-dry dryers will take 100% of their rated capacity.
- Load dryers so that linens fall from the 11 o’clock and the one o’clock positions (the same as with washers).
- Always follow the drying times and temperatures indicated on the chart provided for each load. Always follow with a cool-down cycle for best results. Avoid over-drying items.

# PROCEDURE

## SECTION: Personal Clothing and Linen Processes - Laundry
### DESCRIPTION: Drying Standards and Temperatures
### INDEX: EVS3-P10.06

To reduce wrinkling, only dry personal clothing when you are ready to hang or fold it. When dryer(s) stop, place all hanging garments over the rim of the clean linen bin. Small items such as socks and underwear can be placed inside the bin. Be careful not to wrinkle clothing when handling it.

For safety, always follow proper body mechanics when unloading linens from dryers. Do not attempt to remove linens from dryers until they have gone through a cool-down cycle. Always place linen in bins indicated for “clean linen” only. Follow procedures for cleaning dryer lint screens.

Do not leave hot/warm linen sitting in bins overnight. If you are unable to complete the drying process before the end of your shift, leave washed linen in a clean linen bin, covered.
