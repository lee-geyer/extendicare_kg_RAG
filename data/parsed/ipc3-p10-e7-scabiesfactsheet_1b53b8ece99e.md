## Scabies Fact Sheet

### What are scabies?
Human scabies are caused by a contagious parasitic infestation of the skin by the mite *Sarcoptes scabiei* var. hominis. The microscopic scabies mite burrows into the upper layer of the skin where it lives and lays its eggs. The female mite can lay 10-25 eggs per burrow, which hatch within 2-4 days. The mites mature in 14-17 days.

### What are Crusted scabies?
Crusted scabies, also known as Norwegian or keratotic scabies, is an uncommon form of infestation, characterized by massive infestation of mites, and widespread crusted hyperkeratotic lesions. With crusted scabies, more mites are present and occasionally itching is completely absent. Because a large number of mites inhabit the sloughed skin scales, crusted scabies is highly contagious with casual contact.

### What are the signs and symptoms of scabies?
The most common symptom is intense itching. This is caused by the mites burrowing under the skin to lay eggs. The mites like warm areas of skin, especially the groin, elbows, and armpits but can spread to other areas of the body. The itch is often worst at night when in a warm bed and after a hot shower. A rash, red bumps, or burrows are visible on the skin.

# Scabies Fact Sheet

## What does scabies look like?
Scabies can appear in different ways on the skin and could include:
- A pimple-like rash
- Scales
- Blisters
- Sores caused by scratching

Tiny red or grey burrow tracks can appear between the fingers and on the wrists. They may also be found in other areas of the body including the armpits, torso, buttocks, the penis, and feet. It may take anywhere from 1-6 weeks for symptoms of scabies to show on the skin. People who have previously been infested can develop symptoms 1-4 days after re-exposure.

## How are scabies diagnosed?
Diagnosis is usually made by close examination of changes in the skin but may be difficult in the elderly because of the prevalence of dry, frequently itchy skin or previous history of skin conditions such as eczema. Good, ongoing visual assessment by caregivers during personal care is important. Skin scraping/Ink Blot test of the affected areas may be needed to confirm the presence of scabies.

## How are scabies spread?
Transmission is by direct skin-to-skin contact with an affected individual. Occasionally, scabies can be spread through contact with clothing/bedding of an affected individual but not usually items such as furniture. Personal care activities such as bathing and turning the Resident provide opportunities for transmission to personnel.

Transmission can occur as long as the affected person remains untreated and until 24 hours after the initiation of the appropriate treatment.

## How are scabies treated?
Scabies can be treated quickly and easily with a scabicide lotion. Permethrin 5% lotion in one or two applications is usually recommended. It is common for the itch to persist for several weeks after treatment. Antihistamines and creams may be used to help relieve itching after the treatment.

## Treatment Guidelines
- Clothing and linen that has been in direct contact with the affected areas must be washed in hot water. This should happen immediately after the person has received the scabicide treatment.
- The mites of crusted scabies are the same and sensitive to the same treatment as typical scabies. However, the huge number of mites and the usual accompanying rash make repeat treatment mandatory.
- Treatment should focus on areas where mites can be isolated, such as under the fingernails (these may be brushed before treatment) and in the skin folds, including the umbilicus.

## Prevention of Spread in the Home
- Any unexplained itching or rash should be reported to the nurse and investigated immediately.
- If scabies is confirmed or suspected, Residents will be asked to stay in their room until treatment is received.
- Staff will wear gloves and gowns when in direct contact with the Resident.
- All staff and visitors in close contact with a person suspected or confirmed to have scabies should also receive treatment and stay at home until 24 hours after the treatment.
