## Facility Instruction

### Chapter 2: Performing the Inspections

#### Preparing the Documentation:
1. Lay sling out on a flat surface so that all areas of the sling are visible.
2. Document the basic sling information on your Sling Inspection Report including:
- **Label / Serial #:** from sling tag
- **Location:** the long form name of the resident area.
- **Sling Model #:** as listed on the sling label. (if illegible, indicate n/a – reference check # 5 & 6)
- **Loop or Clip:** indicate L for loop and C for clip style slings.

#### Performing the Physical State Inspections: (Hard Indicators)
Document for “pass” / for “fail” under the appropriate column of the Sling Inspection Report.
1. **Attachments Check:** Check all loops/clips at their connection/stress points. Twist and pull these with your fingers and look for any signs of weakness, particularly on threading. With moderate force, attempt to pull all sling straps at their attachment point to the body of the sling and (for loop slings) within each multiple loop attachment/threading. This inspection will observe for but is not exclusive to fraying, loose stitching and any sign of material breakage on strapping/loop material. Depending on the sling model there may be up to 12 loop/clip points in total.
- For clip style slings, pay particular attention to the area referred to as the **cold shut line** (see figure 4). This is one area that is most vulnerable to damage caused by rollers and presses in mechanical laundry processes.

**Figure 4: Cold Shut Line**
!Cold Shut Line

If there is any sign of deterioration of the attachment points, the check must be documented as for “fail”, if there is no apparent damage, document as for “pass”.

# Sling Inspection Program

## Facility Instruction

1. **Stitching Check**:
- Check stitching of the entire sling including the stitching of all seams, strap connections, and trim.
- The critical areas to inspect are the strap attachment points as indicated in the attachments check but also any sewn/threaded material seams within the body of the sling.
- You should be looking for any fraying or loose stitching in these areas.
- (Loose or deteriorated stitching at head support pockets or on trim material is merely a cosmetic concern and an indication of age; therefore, this alone would not constitute a failure of the stitching check.)
- If there is any sign of deterioration of the stitching at attachment points or at any sewn/threaded material seams, the check must be documented as **fail**; if there is no apparent damage, document as **pass**.

2. **Body Check**:
- Check the body of the sling for any rips or holes.
- If there is any sign of rips, holes, or deterioration of the sling body material in any way, the check must be documented as **fail**; if there is no apparent damage, document as **pass**.

3. **Head Support Stiffeners Check**:
- Note whether or not the sling model requires head support stiffeners. (reference figure 2 - pockets for head support stiffeners)
- If the sling does have pockets for head support stiffeners and they are missing, then you must remove the sling from service until you can review with the resident manager to see if the stays are available to be found.
- If the stays cannot be found, then install new stays from your stock. (document on your FSR as appropriate)
- If for some reason you do not have stock of stays, then you must remove the sling from service until new stays can be installed. (Unless ultimately other aspects of the physical state of the sling require it to be taken out of service - see step 6)
- Document **pass** or n/a if the sling design does not require head supports.

## Performing the Structural Integrity / End of Usable Life Indicators Inspections: (Soft Indicators)

This area of inspection deals with more subtle but equally as important indicators of sling condition. Each of these checks is linked to indications of improper laundering or indications of the age of the sling, both of which represent potentially serious structural and therefore safety risks. Document **pass** / **fail** under the appropriate column of the Sling Inspection Report.

4. **Bleach Damage Check**:
- The best indicator of possible bleach damage is the legibility of the sling label and extremely faded colors in the body fabric or trim sizing color.
- Completely blank or missing labels indicate frequent use and/or laundering with exposure to bleach.
- The major concern relating to this check is that bleach is a harsh chemical known to prematurely deteriorate the sling materials (Stitching / strapping / fabric / plastic). Therefore, the integrity of these materials is unknown.
- Bleach damage will typically first weaken the thread/stitching, and therefore the physical checks described in the attachment and stitching checks will uncover imminent failures.
- However, a bleach-damaged sling, even though it may have passed the physical checks this time, may fail quickly as a result of continued exposure to bleach.
- If bleach damage is evident, the check must be documented as **fail**; otherwise, document as **pass**.

# Sling Inspection Program

## Facility Instruction

### 6) Heat Damage Check
Check the sling for heat damage. This may be detected as an overall shrinking of the sling or may be noticed on the padded leg section and can be identified by a shrinking or scrunching of the leg portion. Additionally, heat damage may be found on other areas by noticing a brittle or ridged/stiff feel to the fabric. There are three concerns about a sling that has heat damage:
- **a. Wrong size = Safety Concern:** If the sling has shrunk, then the size depicted on the label is not accurate and could lead to using the improper sling for the application, representing a potential safety issue.
- **b. Structural Integrity:** Heat damage indicates the sling has been tumble dried at temperatures greater than specified, and therefore the integrity of the stitching and fabric could have deteriorated.
- **c. Patient Comfort:** A sling that exhibits a ridged/stiff feel to the fabric will be more abrasive to the skin, causing discomfort and possibly damage to vulnerable skin, resulting in additional treatment costs.

If heat damage is evident, the check must be documented as **fail**; otherwise, document as **pass**.

### 7) Stain Check
Check the sling for excessive staining. While some staining may occur through use by an incontinent patient, other staining may indicate exposure to chemicals. If there is any suspicion that staining is not a result of use with an incontinent client, then this is an indication of the use of unapproved chemicals in the laundering process. The concern with chemical staining is that unapproved chemicals are known to prematurely deteriorate the materials that make up a sling (stitching / strapping / fabric / plastic). Therefore, the integrity of these materials is unknown.

If non-incontinence related staining is evident, the check must be documented as **fail**; otherwise, document as **pass**.

### 8) Label Check
Check the sling label to ensure that important information on the label is still legible. If this important information is not legible, particularly the type, size, and SWL (Safe Working Load Indicators), it could lead to using the improper sling for the patient or the improper sling for the equipment, representing a potential safety issue. If the labels are not sufficiently legible, the check must be documented as **fail**; if the label is easily legible, document as **pass**. (Also reference check 6)

### 9) Clip Check
Each sling clip is designed to have a partial mechanical resistance to prevent inadvertent dislocation from the spreader bar lug. In some cases, this mechanical resistance when present will produce an audible click when the sling is attached. When this mechanical resistance or audible click is not present, the sling is still safe to use (assuming proper operating instructions are followed). However, if the sling clip does not pass the mechanical resistance check according to the sling clip gauge, this represents a sling that is beyond its useful life. Using the sling clip gauge (Special Tool #ST331):

### Inspection Procedure
1. Insert the machined diameter of the tool into the larger diameter of the keyhole slot in the plastic clip.
2. Allow the weight of the gauge to rest against the sling clip and attempt to pass the gauge pin through the slot in the smaller diameter. **Do not force the gauge through the slot.**
3. The gauge must not pass through the narrow mouth of the section of the plastic clip. If the gauge does pass through, indicate for “Fail” on your Sling Inspection Report.

### Age Check
There are two basic methods to determine the age of a sling:
- **a. Labelling:** All slings manufactured for the last several years have the manufacturing date printed either on the sling label, on a separate label OR if it is a clip sling, all slings manufactured after 1996 have the month/year of manufacture moulded into the clip.

- **b. Design Attributes – Clip Slings:** There are two key visual indicators that can easily identify clip slings that are over 2 years old.
- The first and most obvious is the colour of the fabric. All ARJO slings loop or clip manufactured since MMM-YY have used a blue fabric. All previously manufactured slings use white fabric (believed to be approximately year 2000).
- The second visual indicator applicable to clip slings only is that there have been 4 styles of sling clip used over the past 15 years as depicted in the illustration below. Interpreting this history, any sling that does not have a “zig-zag” style clip was manufactured prior to February 2006.
- (The presence of a non “zig-zag” clip style will confirm that the sling was “manufactured” prior to February 2006; however, this is not a clear indicator of the sling's actual usage age as our last grey clipped slings were sold in mid 2008, so this should be considered. If ultimately the colour of the clip is the only inspection deficiency, the sling should “pass” inspection.)

### c. Design Attributes – Loop Slings
- All ARJO manufactured loop slings manufactured since **MMM-YY** have used a blue fabric.
- All previously manufactured slings use white fabric (believed to be approximately year 2000).
- All BHM manufactured loop slings manufactured since **MMM-YY** have white fabric or light grey mesh but some of the loops will be coloured/non-white (believed to be approximately year 2002).

Therefore, if you have an ARJO loop sling with white fabric OR a BHM sling with white loops, they are most definitely over 2 years old.

If any of the indicators above confirm that a sling has likely been in service for over 2 years, the check must be documented as "fail"; otherwise, document as "pass".
