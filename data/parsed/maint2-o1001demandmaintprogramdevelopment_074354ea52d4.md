# POLICY
## Remedial (Demand) Maintenance Program

### PROCEDURE

- Demand Maintenance (also known as Remedial Maintenance, Corrective Maintenance or 'Repair') is a systematic approach used to repair damage or to get equipment working again once a problem has been discovered.
- Because Demand Maintenance addresses problems as they arise, it tends to be more non-routine and less predictable than Preventive Maintenance. This also increases the tendency for it to become more chaotic and less easy to manage.
- When a piece of equipment poses a danger to workers, that equipment will be “locked-out” until repaired. Lockout ensures that a machine, or process that is shut down for maintenance, cleaning, or any other procedure, is secured against accidental start-up or movement. All staff will be made aware of this process for all equipment that needs repair.
- If equipment repairs cannot be completed immediately, maintenance staff must:
a. Evaluate the risk of allowing the continued use of the equipment while it awaits repairs;
b. Tag the defective equipment with a lock-out tag if it is deemed to be unsuitable for use;
c. Either remove the tagged equipment to a secure designated area or take necessary precautions to prevent use of the equipment by residents, staff or visitors until repairs can be made;
d. Inform the appropriate staff of the nature of the problem and any precautions taken.
- The Maintenance Manager/Designate will develop a program to provide remedial maintenance to equipment and systems. They will also evaluate the program annually.
- One of the ways to manage this type of maintenance is to first recognize the several types of situations that may develop and then form a plan of appropriate actions for each type.
- The response to a problem may be different depending on when the problem is discovered. Problems may develop during normal operating hours when the home’s management staff and maintenance staff are in the building, or they may develop outside normal operating hours when the home’s management staff and the maintenance staff are not in the building. The problem may also receive a different response depending on if it is an emergency, or some lower priority situation.

## PROCEDURE

### SECTION: Remedial
### DESCRIPTION: Demand Maintenance
### INDEX: MAINT2-010.01

There are 4 basic levels of priority:

1. **Emergency** – A problem requiring immediate attention to correct a situation which is endangering the safety of residents, staff, and/or visitors. Remedial work is needed immediately to restore life safety systems or essential services to ensure protection of the residents, employees, and/or the physical plant.
- **Note:** The severity of the problem may distinguish between whether it is an emergency item or a high priority item. When in doubt, check with the Executive Director.

2. **High Priority** – A situation which does not represent an immediate threat to the safety of residents, staff and/or visitors but requires quick attention to:
- a. prevent deterioration into an emergency
- b. maintain resident comfort
- c. meet codes and/or regulations
- d. prevent deprivation of services in life safety systems or building support systems; or
- e. protect property and/or prevent significant financial loss.

3. **Regular Priority** – A problem or repair which may be scheduled to be addressed as part of the upcoming daily activities scheduled in the routine Preventive Maintenance calendar.

4. **Routine Priority** – Problems or repairs that are periodic and pre-planned as part of a routine work schedule, similar to the preventive maintenance program but not addressing key systems or equipment, such as changing lightbulbs.

- **Note:** To review how to respond to levels of priority please review the “Priority Level Response” tool associated with this program.

### Computer-Assisted Program

- In recent years, there have been several companies offering computer software and applications that provide for maintenance scheduling.
- Most of this software does not work well managing preventive maintenance programs for small maintenance departments but does seem to have been developed more towards providing a reporting system that allows for better notification of the need for Demand Maintenance.
- Some of these systems could be incorporated as part of the Demand Maintenance Program, provided the overall program is designed to include all the features listed under this section of Regular and Routine Priority Service.
