## POLICY

Extendicare is committed to ensuring that every resident experiences a welcoming, respectful, and seamless transition into the home. Our move-in process upholds residents' rights to privacy, dignity, and choice, while respecting their needs and preferences. An individualized plan of care is developed for each resident, regularly reviewed, and revised as needed, in alignment with organizational policy, legislation, and jurisdictional requirements.

## STANDARD

- All relevant departments must be informed of each new resident's arrival in accordance with the home's established notification process.
- Residents and substitute decision maker (SDM) or Power of Attorney (POA) must be given the opportunity to participate in developing a plan of care that reflects individual needs and preferences.
- Interdisciplinary assessments and plan of care review or revision are required:
- Upon move-in (24 hr. care plan & initial plan of care developed)
- Quarterly
- Upon a change in condition
- Upon return from hospital
- The interdisciplinary team must ensure that the plan of care is accurate and reflective of the resident’s current status.
- Move-in consent forms must be implemented as required, ensuring residents and SDM/POA receive sufficient information to make informed decisions about treatment options.
- Holistic and interdisciplinary assessments must be completed and used to align goals and ensure continuity of person-centred care and services, in accordance with interRAI timelines, jurisdictional, regional, and provincial requirements.
- Resident transfers and discharges must be conducted safely and in a coordinated manner to support continuity of care. This includes:
- Communicating relevant health and care information to receiving facilities or care providers
- Engaging residents and SDM/POA in the discharge planning process
- Facilitating a smooth transition with necessary support services, as applicable.
