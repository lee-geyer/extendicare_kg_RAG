### Major Life Changes

- Disconnection from spiritual/cultural/religious involvement may also increase the risk of suicidal thinking.

### Feelings of Being a Burden
- Some older adults may worry about being a burden to others.

### Medical Illness and/or Pain

### Reminder
Person-centred care is an approach that respects the unique values, history, culture, and preferences of individuals, promoting dignity, collaboration, and quality of life in care. Person-centred care focuses on residents’ strengths, capabilities, preferences, and priorities and is adapted to their varying cognitive abilities and communication styles. You will see person-centred care as a core value embedded throughout our policy, procedures, and tools for the Mental Health & Dementia Care program.
