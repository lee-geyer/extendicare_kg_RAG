## POLICY

### Communicable Diseases

## PROCEDURE

### Screening

- Consider Group A Streptococcus (GAS) when a resident displays signs and symptoms including:
- fever
- sore throat (pharyngitis)
- skin infections such as:
- impetigo (sores that can blister and develop a honey-colored crust)
- erysipelas (raised, bright red infection of the skin)
- Scarlet Fever (a rash that can feel rough like sandpaper, is worse in the skin folds and can cause some skin peeling when it resolves)

- Invasive Group A streptococcal infections (iGAS) are rare and can cause severe symptoms and signs, such as:
- fever and shortness of breath due to pneumonia
- fever, severe pain and redness due to breakdown of the tissues under the skin as a result of necrotizing fasciitis
- fever, chills, muscle aches, and nausea and vomiting

### Management

- Place suspected/confirmed residents on droplet and contact precautions.
- Notify the Infection Control Professional (ICP)/Designate upon confirmation of a case of GAS in the home.
- Notify the health authority of suspect or confirmed invasive GAS strep infection and follow their direction including screening, testing and additional precautions.
- Notify physician/nurse practitioner for treatment options and medication orders if needed.
- If iGAS is suspected, the primary care provider must be immediately consulted for necessary interventions (e.g., transfer to the hospital).
- Provide education to staff on the signs and symptoms of GAS and iGAS and the necessary precautions as needed.
- Once a resident has been treated with appropriate antibiotics for more than 24 hours, they are no longer considered contagious and additional precautions can be discontinued.
