## Description of Maintenance Forms and Logs

In the Maintenance Program, there are samples of forms that have been found to be useful in organizing the maintenance work and keeping a record that the work was done. Some facilities may choose to use different forms to organize their programs or may choose to use a computer-based system. The actual method or form used to organize the maintenance work is not significant, provided an organized system is in place that accomplishes the same results. A brief explanation of how to use each of the sample forms follows:

### Daily Log

This form is designed to help maintenance staff remember to do the most important daily activities. It should be used as a guide to help ensure that these tasks are completed every day that maintenance workers are on duty. One page (both sides) should be used for an entire week. If maintenance staff do not work on any day (such as a Sunday or a vacation), then the form should be marked to indicate that the daily work was not done on that day. This can be done by striking a line or an ‘X’ over the column for that day.

On the form, each day is divided into three columns. This allows information to be recorded for up to three similar items, such as three boilers or temperature readings in three different rooms. On page 2, there are also places where multiple lines are used for the same item, such as fire exit doors and CO detectors. This allows a record to be made for up to 15 fire exit doors (five lines by three columns) and 12 CO detectors (four lines by three columns).

When completing this form, some responses will require a number (such as water temperature) and other responses will require that ‘OK’ be written. This is needed to demonstrate to compliance officials that the building has been inspected.

**NOTE:** Once completed, log sheets shall be permanent records of inspection. Current log sheets for a given year should be filed in three-ring binders. Older log sheets should be filed in manila folders and maintained as inactive records.

### Annual Calendar

The Annual Maintenance Calendar can be used to indicate critical dates of any maintenance service contracts (i.e., renewal date as well as months in which inspections or services are scheduled). It provides a simple place to record when any annual or semiannual inspections are required, such as fire alarm inspections or electrical generator inspections.

A separate Annual Maintenance Calendar can also be used to help schedule the annual inspections and repairs of the resident rooms and inspections of resident-owned equipment. The room numbers can be distributed across the calendar so that every month some of the rooms are addressed with the intention that all of the rooms will be inspected by the end of the year. This allows the work to be carried out in a more organized manner.

### Service Firm Log

This form was created to help record the visit(s) of each service provider performing work on or within the facility. The log is in strategic locations throughout the home, such as the front entrance, the maintenance office, the kitchen, etc. Contractors are asked to sign in and out when entering the building and to describe in a few words what they were called to do. This record can then be used when questioning the time charged on invoices from the contractor.

## Monthly Maintenance Calendar

The Monthly Maintenance Calendar is used to help schedule the regular Preventive Maintenance work required on the building and equipment. Each separate Monthly Maintenance Calendar will be used to schedule all maintenance work that would be applicable to that month: weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, and annually. There is no need to indicate daily preventive maintenance work, as this should be guided by the work routine as described in the daily log.

The monthly maintenance calendars, once developed, may be used year after year. The maintenance work should be identical from year to year. It would be altered only when new equipment is added or old equipment is replaced. It may be noticed that this calendar does not have any dates in it, only the days of the week. The calendar should be used where the first square represents the first Monday of the month and all other days follow in sequence. By not numbering the days, the calendar becomes more flexible and can be used for any month.

The maintenance check-sheets for the equipment have a separate number for each procedure. The calendar can be completed by writing the appropriate number in one square of the monthly calendar, indicating that procedure should be completed on that day, and other procedures in other squares. All the maintenance procedures used by a facility should have the numbers spread evenly over the available workdays of the month.

It is recommended that no procedures be scheduled for Mondays or Fridays, since those days tend to be more likely to have many repair requests and other interruptions. It is also recommended that work of a similar nature be scheduled for the same day. For example, it might be more convenient if all work in the kitchen were scheduled on the same day. Different colors can be used to indicate that some procedures are quarterly, semi-annual, or annual maintenance, or the procedure number can be followed by a letter (Q, S, or A) to indicate that a more intensive maintenance procedure will be done.

It must be remembered that these calendars are intended to help schedule the regular preventive maintenance but cannot be expected to predict all of the unexpected events in the life of the facility. It will often happen that an event may prevent some maintenance from being completed on the day it was scheduled. This includes such things as visits from regulatory officials, sickness or vacation, sudden emergencies such as a heating system failure, etc. When this happens, the maintenance workers are expected to be flexible and deal with the issue, then carry out the preventive maintenance at another time or another day later in the month. There may be times when the preventive maintenance for a piece of equipment cannot be carried out during that month. This is not unusual and in most situations not critical to the operation of the equipment. However, if a procedure cannot be completed one month, then it should definitely not be missed the following month.

## Maintenance Request Log

The Maintenance Request Log is a simple way for staff, residents, or visitors to advise maintenance of a need to have something repaired. Generally, blank copies of these pages are inserted into 3-ring binders and distributed throughout the home in locations where people can easily find them and enter requests for maintenance. Most homes place one copy of the binder at each nursing station and at the main reception desk. Anyone who sees something in need of repair can simply write on the form what is required and in which room.

# Description of Maintenance Forms and Logs

Maintenance workers must check each logbook when completing the morning rounds, review the requests, insert a priority number for each entry, and develop a plan to carry out the repairs. For example, if several books have entries related to lights not working, maintenance could plan on tending to all these lighting problems consecutively before addressing another series of problems, such as repairing all leaking faucets. Anything given a priority of 1 (such as a damaged nurse call) should be addressed right away. Once the repairs have been completed, the maintenance person should enter the log that the corrective action was taken, so that the person who requested it can see that it was done. Maintenance may want to check the log several times during the day, preferably once in the morning and once in the afternoon, in case new items have been added during the day. If some items on the Maintenance Request Log cannot be completed within a reasonable time, then the maintenance person should write on the log the reason for the delay (such as “parts on order – expected in three days”) so that the person requesting the work has some idea of why it has not been completed and when they should expect it to be done. Maintenance should review these logs on a weekly basis to ensure that any incomplete items have been addressed and repaired.

## Temperature Log

The Temperature Log is provided to allow kitchen and laundry staff to monitor and record water or air temperatures for a variety of kitchen and laundry equipment (e.g., washers, dryers, etc.). Blank pages of the log should be inserted into 3-ring binders, one of which is left in the kitchen and one left in the laundry where department staff can complete the log. The date can be written in the blank spaces that are provided below the days of the week. Indicate the name of the equipment being monitored in the blank space in the left column above the word “Time”. Record the temperatures taken in the row to the right of the equipment name. Record the time at which temperatures are taken in the row to the right of the heading “Time”. Initial the notations in the space provided to the right of the heading “Initial”.

Columns 1, 2, and 3 are provided under each weekday heading to accommodate up to three (3) recordings per day.

## Monthly Maintenance Report

The Monthly Maintenance Report is a report from the Maintenance Department to the Executive Director and should be completed at the end of each month. It is intended to summarize the significant data and events that occurred during the preceding month and provide a brief history of what has occurred over the month. It will place emphasis on:

- Highlights of inspection and tests
- Results of any inspections from regulatory authorities
- Summary of significant non-routine activities
- Status of routine work (current or backlogged)
- Other problems.

It also provides a place to list any major expenses that occurred during the month, either from using contractors or from purchasing parts or maintenance supplies. It may be useful to list any purchase that costs more than $500. This information can be useful if there is a need at a later date to explain the status of the maintenance budget.

## List of Budget Items for Future Considerations

As maintenance staff go about their daily duties, they often come across situations that leave them thinking that some item should be replaced, either due to age or obsolescence or ongoing maintenance costs, or some major work should be done, but they know that it cannot be accomplished without capital funding.

This form is provided as a way to keep an ongoing list of these ideas and suggestions so that they are not lost. At budget time, when the capital budget is being proposed, the Executive Director can review this list of the various ideas and suggestions that have developed over the year and use it to provide an overview of what is needed; the most important items can then be selected for the capital budget.

## Externally Generated Documents Required For Compliance

These critical inspections and reports are generally required by code or regulations and are performed as required by certified service firms. The companies that perform these inspections generally use their own forms to record the information. The home should receive a copy of the completed form, have any deficiencies corrected, and file the form in a way that makes it easy to retrieve. Tab 7 lists specifications that can be used to describe the work that external contractors can be expected to do when completing these inspections.

## Reference Documents

Reference documents are valuable, in terms of time and money spent in their development, and in terms of their value to the maintenance of the facility if properly utilized. They shall be protected and maintained in good order for ready access.

Reference documents serve the following purposes:

- To provide procedural information for the performance of routine activities
- To provide guidance in trouble-shooting equipment and system problems
- To provide a basis for modifications or renovations
- To help develop an improved understanding of equipment and systems, leading to better operation and maintenance
- To serve as orientation material for new employees.

## Owner’s Equipment Manuals

A typical owner’s manual provides instructions on installation, operation, maintenance and often also part lists that are specific to the intended equipment. Generally, these instructions supersede all other instructions (except regulatory instructions) and, in cases of new equipment, must be followed for warranties to be honored by manufacturers. Manuals shall be maintained in three-ring binders or folders, in an organized manner according to the designated equipment. It is sometimes useful to keep manuals for similar equipment together. For example, manuals for all laundry equipment might be kept in one binder or folder, while manuals for all kitchen equipment might be kept in another, and manuals for all ventilation equipment in a third, etc.

These manuals should be kept until the equipment is discarded. Care should be exercised that contractors who work on the equipment do not remove the manuals and fail to return them. It is advisable that the manuals be kept in the maintenance library and contractors only allowed to read them there. Contractors should only be allowed to take copies of a manual from the library.

## Design Drawings (Blueprints)
These drawings provide design information for architectural, civil/structure, electrical, and mechanical (HVAC) designs. Drawings covering original construction, renovations, and expansions shall be maintained. Drawings shall be filed by clamping one end between sticks and hanging flat on a wall or bracket. They should not be kept in rolls.

## Codes and Regulations
There are many codes, standards, and regulations that affect the maintenance and operation of the facility. These documents are revised regularly and are often difficult to keep in a current state. Each home will have to decide which documents to keep in the maintenance library. The Extendicare Asset Management Department has copies of many of these documents at the corporate office or at the regional office and can provide information relating to the code, standard, or regulation if asked. For many homes, this is adequate for their needs and they do not feel a need to keep copies in their libraries.
