- For an ESBL colonization, implement contact precautions for direct care.
- Follow Testing Program for Multi-Drug Resistant Organism Algorithm for surveillance testing based on health authority direction.

#### Retirement Specific:

If ESBL is identified, it will be noted on the plan of care. Appropriate precautions will remain in place until it is cleared, or the resident moves out.
