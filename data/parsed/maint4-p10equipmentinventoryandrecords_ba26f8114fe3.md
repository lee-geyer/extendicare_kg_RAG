## POLICY
The equipment records for all key equipment shall be compiled and maintained in a binder by the maintenance department. This ensures the information is readily accessible when contacting suppliers or contractors for replacement parts or service.

## STANDARD
- Manuals should be stored in the maintenance office, ideally organized in a binder or filing cabinet to create a comprehensive maintenance library.
- To ensure proper maintenance and repair of equipment, it is vital for the Maintenance Department to maintain comprehensive records. These should include:
- A list of all key equipment
- Detailed descriptions
- Relevant manufacturer manuals
- Parts lists
- Installation guides
- Operating instructions
- Effective equipment records serve as a critical tool for monitoring inventory changes and tracking long-term assets. Damage to equipment can occur due to overuse, poor storage, improper maintenance, or unforeseen circumstances. By carefully tracking equipment, businesses can monitor asset conditions and ensure timely maintenance, reducing the likelihood of failures.
- Additionally, efficient equipment tracking enhances operational efficiency by enabling teams to locate and manage assets with ease. This helps prevent downtime and maximizes productivity.
