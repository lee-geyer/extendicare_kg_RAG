## POLICY
### Immunization of Residents and Staff

## PROCEDURE
Registered staff will:

1. Collect and request information related to vaccination history of a new resident upon admission.
2. Consider a resident who reports incomplete immunization or lacking adequate documentation of immunization as unimmunized and start the resident on an immunization schedule appropriate for their age and risk factors.
3. Obtain up-to-date information (i.e., fact sheet, consent form, etc.) from the health authority.
4. Provide information related to vaccination to the resident or substitute decision-maker (SDM) following collection of information related to vaccination status of the resident. Outline the risks and benefits, and the reasons vaccination is important in long-term care.
5. Obtain informed consent as per provincial legislation prior to giving the proposed treatment. Informed consent must include:
- the nature of the treatment;
- the expected benefits of the treatment;
- the risk and side effects of the treatment, if any; and
- the possible consequences of not having the treatment.
6. Review the Resident Informed Consent for TB Screening and Vaccinations form and obtain consent on admission and as required by having the resident or their SDM sign the form.
7. Ensure that each resident admitted is screened for active tuberculosis within 14 days of admission. There must be documented results for the screening process.
8. Offer a copy of the Resident Informed Consent for TB Screening and Vaccinations form to the resident or their SDM and initial the form in the appropriate location. Alert the physician/nurse practitioner if the resident/SDM refuses consent, allowing the physician/nurse practitioner the opportunity to review the consent form with the resident and others during the admission process.
9. Review the vaccination information of a new resident. The physician/nurse practitioner may order additional vaccinations based on the recommendations of:
- Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis (Td/Tdap);
