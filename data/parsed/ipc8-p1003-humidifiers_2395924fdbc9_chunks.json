Document the discussion and the date the humidifier was removed from the home in progress notes.",

Too low or too high indoor relative humidity has been shown to increase the rates of respiratory illness and contribute to the growth of mould and fungi within buildings. Humidifiers that atomize water to generate micro-sized droplets in the air (referred to as an aerosol) can potentially distribute any microbial contaminants present in that water or in biofilms that develop on humidifier tanks, reservoirs, and spouts. Contaminated room humidifiers have been linked to both health care-acquired and community-acquired infections. Standing water in humidifiers/diffusers has been linked as the source of Legionnaires’ disease and Pontiac fever, as well as other airborne pathogens affected by levels of indoor relative humidity.----Helping people live betterThis document is uncontrolled when printed.",
