## POLICY

### Cleaning and Organization

## PROCEDURE

- Understand that stripping completely removes all floor finish right down to the sealer coat.

### Frequency:

- If floors are well maintained by housekeeping staff (i.e., kept clean and buffed regularly) they will require less stripping.
- Floor stripping will be done as planned by the Manager or designate in conjunction with the Nursing department. Please consult your manager/designate for schedule.

### Collect the following items:
- floor machine (low speed) with drive pad assembly or auto scrubber
- stripping pads (brown or black)
- mats for wiping feet
- two buckets – one with hot stripping solution and one with clear water
- dust mop
- dust pan and counter brush
- disposable gloves
- floor finish and sealer (if required) or finish/sealer product

## Floor Stripping Procedure:

1. Collect all supplies necessary to complete the task.
2. Clear furniture and equipment from the area being stripped.
3. Dust mop the entire floor surface.
4. Place wet floor signs at the beginning and end of the area.
5. Apply baseboards with selected baseboard cleaner and let stand.
6. Dip mop into stripping solution and apply a liberal amount of stripping to the floor area.
- Cover a reasonable area at one time (i.e., 50 square feet).
7. Scrub edges of the floor with a doodle bug pad.
8. Attach a coarse pad to the machine and strip the perimeter of the area being done.
9. Work in a counterclockwise direction towards the furthest boundary.
- Overlap edges and work back to the beginning so that the floor receives two treatments.
- Heel machine to remove stubborn marks or use a scraper and steel wool.
10. Pick up stripping solution with a wet vacuum, if available.
11. Continue the procedure until the entire area has been stripped.
12. Using steel wool or a scrub pad, clean baseboards.
13. Wet mop the floor surface using a liberal amount of clear water.
- Be sure to remove all stripper residues or the new finish will not adhere to the floor properly.
14. Follow the procedure for applying floor finish.
15. When completed, replace furniture and equipment. Return supplies to the designated storage area.
16. **Note:** Marmoleum requires a special stripper and cannot have excessive amounts of stripping solution on the floor for long periods. This product is made of natural fibers and will absorb solution/water.
17. If the home has an automatic scrubber, follow the procedure outlined by the manufacturer.
18. Rubber shoes must be worn during the procedure and exercise caution when walking on wet floors.
19. Scrub the floor with the machine along a path similar to that shown in the diagram.
