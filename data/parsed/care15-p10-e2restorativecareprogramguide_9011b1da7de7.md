# Introduction

Extendicare believes that each resident has the right to be involved in their care and should receive the most appropriate support to achieve their optimal level of functioning and improve their quality of life. All homes will implement a continuum of restorative care and services in keeping with available funding and regulatory requirements, including restorative nursing care programs aimed at:

- improving function
- preventing decline in function
- promoting independence
- fostering self-efficacy and self-esteem

This guidebook provides staff with information necessary to successfully implement a Restorative Care Program in the home, including tips and tools for improving or maintaining:

- Range of Motion (active and passive)
- Splint/Brace Assistance
- Bed Mobility
- Transfer
- Walking
- Dressing/Grooming
- Eating/Swallowing
- Amputation/Prosthetic Care
- Communication
- Scheduled Toileting
- Other (e.g. PT/OT/Rec/Respiratory Therapy/Social work)

# Program Overview

## Restorative Care Coordinating Committee

The Restorative Care Coordinating Committee is directed by designated leads (DOC/designate) and focuses on interventions of intensity and duration beyond usual care. Restorative care activities must be goal-oriented, planned, scheduled, and documented daily.

The program builds on an overall interdisciplinary restorative approach to care. It uses motivational, supportive, and training techniques to foster a “can do” philosophy, engage residents in self-care, and help them to maximize their remaining strengths and abilities.

Restorative care complements specialized rehabilitation such as physiotherapy, less intensive exercise, and other restorative programs available in the home. Whereas rehabilitation (i.e., PT, OT, etc.) is designed to achieve improvements over a relatively short time, restorative nursing focuses on longer-term, lower intensity interventions that help residents to recover or compensate for skills lost due to disease, disuse, and other factors (CCAA, nd). Interventions are carried out daily by a trained professional under the direction of the designated lead in accordance with the care plan.

Residents may participate in one or more restorative nursing programs, rehabilitation, exercise, or other restorative programs at the same time depending on need/eligibility and resources available in the home. These programs may also be delivered consecutively or intermittently in keeping with resident needs and goals of care. Decisions regarding which programs will be most beneficial and the appropriate sequence and duration of each will be made in collaboration with the resident (or SDM) and Restorative Care Coordinating Committee. In cases where the resident is enrolled in more than one program at the same time, the home will ensure that the interventions and goals of care of each program are distinct, complementary, and appropriate to the level of care of the resident.

The Nursing Rehabilitation lead will be a nurse (RN, RPN/LPN), ideally with advanced knowledge of restorative interventions and the interRAI process.

Each home will designate a specially trained member(s) of the Restorative Care Coordinating Committee (who may or may not be the Restorative Care Lead) to educate Personal Support Workers (PSW), Health Care Aides (HCA), and other direct care staff on restorative techniques.

# Determining Resident Potential to Benefit from the Restorative Care Program

## Questions to Ask Residents & Families
- What are your goals?
- What would you like to do differently?
- What/who do you think could help you to achieve your goals?
- How do you feel about the program and your progress?
- Do you have suggestions or changes you would like us to make?
- What is important to you in continuing to pursue your goals?
- What could staff do better to continue to help you to achieve your goals?

*Source: RAI MDS Guidelines and FAM, Canadian Centre for Activity and Aging, Western University, 2015*

## To determine if a resident will benefit from a restorative program consider the following questions:
- Does analysis of the interRAI assessment and other assessments indicate that the resident could benefit from a restorative maintenance or restorative improvement program?
- Would the resident’s needs and goals of care be appropriately met by a restorative care program?
- Would the same restorative or maintenance goal(s) be met with:
- a) routine care,
- b) exercise programs, or
- c) less intensive restorative approaches?
- Where available, would specialized therapies of greater intensity (e.g., PT) be more appropriate?
- Would concurrent delivery of both restorative nursing and specialized therapies (e.g. PT, OT, RT) address clinical needs or produce significant functional benefits that would likely not be achieved through other means?
- Do special assessments (rehab, nursing, dietary etc.) indicate the resident has the physical, cognitive and emotional capacity to participate in a restorative program?
- Is the resident able to follow direction?
- Is the resident motivated to improve his/her function?
- Is the resident’s health relatively stable?

### 1. Introduction
N.B. Residents with a significant level of impairment may require restorative nursing care to prevent adverse events (e.g. contractures).

### 2. Purpose
Resident need should drive the selection, intensity, and duration of restorative interventions.

### 3. Scope
Some of these interventions may not be eligible for coding as nursing restorative care; however, it is still expected that interdisciplinary restorative interventions and approach to care will be provided for all residents.

### 4. Quality Indicators
The results of this restorative approach will be reflected in our quality indicators and demonstrate our commitment to providing high-quality care to our residents.

### 5. Benefits
- Improving resident function and preventing decline will also assist staff by reducing the need for assistance required to carry out basic activities of daily living.

# interRAI LTCF Outcome Scales: Considerations for Restorative Care Program

## Using interRAI LTCF Outcome Scales reports for Restorative Care Planning

Outcome Scales are derived from data collected by the interdisciplinary completion of MDS 2.0 assessment. They are a series of scales and indices that can be used to evaluate and/or monitor the clinical status of a Resident or group of Residents and to track changes over time. The scales should be considered at every Resident’s quarterly review. It is essential to look at the previous completed MDS assessment and compare it to the current MDS assessment to understand if the Resident is improving, declining, or maintaining his/her level of function. This will factor into determining if a restorative care program is required.

## Table 1: interRAI LTCF Outcome Scales

| Outcome Scale and Definition | interRAI (LTCF) Assessment Items | What Does the Score Mean | Considerations for Restorative Care |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS)** | • Cognitive Skills for Daily Decision-Making (C1)
• Short-term memory OK (C2a)
• Making Self Understood (D1)
• Eating (G1j) | Scores range from 0-6. Higher scores indicate greater cognitive impairment. | Indicates the extent to which the Resident will be able to independently participate in a restorative care program; assists to understand how to structure restorative activities and the amount and type of supervision and cues that may be required for the Resident to be successful. Set realistic goals. If score of 5 and 6, potential for improvement may be limited – will need other goals e.g. prevent ulcers, contractures. |
| **Pressure Ulcer Risk Scale (PURS)** | • Walking (G1e)
• Bed mobility (G1i)
• Bowel Continence (H3)
• Dyspnea (J3)
• Frequency with which person complains or shows evidence of pain (J5a)
• Weight loss of 5% or more in last 30 days or 10% or more in last 180 days (K2a) | Scale ranges from 0-8. High scores indicate a greater risk for developing a new pressure ulcer. | Review past and current results to identify any risk factors. Look at codes contributing to risk to address with restorative care. |

# Restorative Nursing Program: Range of Motion

## Purpose
To assist residents to maintain and improve their functional status by involving them in an active and/or passive Range of Motion program. Range of motion is a program of passive or active movements to maintain flexibility and functional movement in the joints of the body.

### CIHI Definition
- **Passive ROM (P3a)**: The extent to which, or the limits between which, a part of the body can be moved around a fixed point, or joint.
- **Active ROM (P3b)**: Exercises performed by a resident, with cueing or supervision by staff that are planned, scheduled, and documented in the clinical record.

## Passive Range of Motion
Two (2) or more of the following:
- □ Cannot move limb(s)
- □ Post CVA
- □ Post fracture
- □ Post TKR and/or THR
- □ Risk of contractures
- □ Pain from reduced ability to move joints
- □ Staff assistance will prevent deterioration

## Active Range of Motion
### Upper Extremities
Two (2) or more of the following:
- □ Resident is functionally independent in movement of the upper extremities
- □ Resident is able to lift his/her arms and touch the top of his/her head.
- □ Resident is able to bend his/her elbows and bring his/her hands to mouth.
- □ Resident is able to squeeze or shake your hand.

# Specialized Rehabilitation – Guidelines for Management

Specialized Rehabilitation teams across Canada are typically external agencies/contracted individuals; however, they are fully integrated into the interdisciplinary resident care teams and function as collaborative team members. They are expected to meet service and quality standards outlined in the Service Agreement, meet provincial legislation and regulations, adhere to policies and procedures, and follow professional standards of practice. To support effective collaboration and meet requirements, clear communication and reporting processes should be established among the home, with the staff, and agency when applicable.

## Key Guidelines
- PT, OT, SLP’s and assistants should be assigned to each home by an external agency as per the agreement, where applicable.
- Homes will designate a Program/Recreation Manager or designate to oversee the administrative and service accountability of rehabilitation services and act as the primary liaison.
- The National and Regional teams will support the oversight of the overall service quality and clinical performance of the teams.

## Suggested Programs & Services: Exercise Programs
Rehabilitation programs support mobility, QoL, and resident independence. Homes should ensure that all rehabilitation programs do not exceed the 1:4 ratio during implementation and documentation practices.

### Table 3: Sample Specialized Rehabilitation Programs
Below is a list of sample rehabilitation programs with descriptions and goals to support the development of Program Plans. In some cases, Program Plans will be available corporately to access on documentation platforms.

| Program        | Eligibility                                   | Description                                                                 | Goals                                                                                     |

# Suggested Programs & Services: Hot & Cold Therapies

Hot and cold therapies support healing, reduce pain, and improve function. Cold therapy is typically used in early stages of injury or after exercise to reduce inflammation, swelling, and pain. Heat therapy is commonly used to relax muscles, increase blood flow, and improve tissue flexibility. Heat can be applied pre-exercise to loosen stiff joints or muscles. Hot and cold therapies will only be used on residents who have been approved by the therapist delivered by a trained professional. Hydrocollators are recommended for hot pack therapies and homes are responsible for reading and following the manufacturer directions and guidelines. Temperature and cleaning logs should be completed on a regular basis for treatments where applicable.

## Suggested Programs & Services: Paraffin Wax Program

Paraffin wax therapies support pain relief, circulation, and muscle relaxation. Paraffin wax will only be used on residents who have been approved by the Occupational Therapist (OT) and delivered by a trained professional. The following competency will be demonstrated to the OT prior to conducting therapy:

- Proper temperature checks completed
- Wax temperature records available and completed correctly
- Hands of aide and resident sanitized and soaked in water
- Aide safely dips resident’s hand in wax
- Wrists is extended/dorsiflexed to allow proper wax coverage
- Hand does not touch side or bottom of wax bath
- Clean plastic bags are used and placed over hand
- Mitt is properly placed over hand
- After treatment bags are disposed of
- Wax volume is checked and replenished as needed
- Wax bath is cleaned as per manufacturer's instructions
- Wax bath has a cleaning record that is signed and dated

## Mobility Equipment

The interdisciplinary team will support residents in accessing proper mobility equipment and devices (e.g. wheelchairs). The home will be responsible for ensuring mobility equipment and devices are clean and in good working condition. The Restorative Care Aide and/or designate will develop a plan to support and maintain a regular cleaning schedule of all walkers and wheelchairs. In addition to regular cleaning, annually the home should liaise with their contracted mobility partner (i.e. Motion) to provide annual wheelchair cleaning. The preventative maintenance checklist will also be maintained for all mobility equipment.

When a power-mobility device is requested, the physiotherapist, occupational therapist and/or designate will complete the PIDA assessment. Should a resident be eligible for such devices, they will sign the power-mobility device agreement with the assessor. The resident will be reassessed annually, with significant change in status, or when an incident occurs.

# Respiratory Therapy

Respiratory therapy services are an integral part of the restorative care program, aimed at enhancing residents’ quality of life by maintaining and improving respiratory function. Grounded in a strengths-based, restorative approach, these services promote independence and maximize participation in daily activities while supporting residents’ respiratory health.

The interdisciplinary team conducts the interRAI assessment, focusing on key indicators such as respiratory diagnoses, shortness of breath, oxygen use, recurrent respiratory infections, and performance in activities of daily living (ADLs). When concerns are identified, the nurse refers the resident to the Restorative Care Coordinating Committee as a pathway to evaluate their eligibility for therapy. This collaborative approach ensures timely identification of residents who may benefit from individualized respiratory interventions. Services are delivered in a safe, inclusive, and person-centered environment, with a focus on education, engagement, and active participation.

## Key Respiratory Therapy Techniques

1. **Diaphragmatic Breathing**: A deep breathing technique that uses the diaphragm instead of chest muscles to improve lung expansion, reduce breathing effort, and promote relaxation.
2. **Pursed-Lip Breathing**: Involves inhaling through the nose and exhaling slowly through pursed lips. Helps keep airways open, reduces shortness of breath, and improves ventilation.
3. **Incentive Spirometry**: A device-assisted exercise encouraging deep breaths to expand the lungs. Helps prevent atelectasis and improve lung function, especially after illness or inactivity.
4. **Chest Physiotherapy**: Uses techniques like percussion and vibration to loosen mucus in the lungs, aiding airway clearance in residents with chronic respiratory issues.
5. **Postural Drainage**: Positioning the body to use gravity to help drain mucus from specific lung areas. Often combined with chest physiotherapy.
6. **Non-Invasive Ventilation (CPAP/BiPAP)**
- **CPAP**: Provides constant airflow to keep airways open during sleep or distress.
- **BiPAP**: Delivers two pressure levels—higher when inhaling and lower when exhaling—to ease breathing.
7. **Nebulizer Treatments**: Converts liquid medication (e.g., bronchodilators) into a mist for inhalation. Used to treat inflammation and improve breathing.
8. **Resident and Family Education**: Equips residents and families with knowledge on equipment use, symptom management, early warning signs, and basic respiratory self-care.

Respiratory care plans are individualized, goal-oriented, and evaluated regularly to ensure effectiveness. Delivered by trained professionals (trained nurses and/or respiratory therapists), these services contribute to improved comfort, functional ability, and resident-centered outcomes.

# Social Work and Social Services

Social Work and Social Services are available at the home level and via community supports where applicable and are an integral part of the interdisciplinary team. Resident quality of life is enhanced through timely access to social work and social services that foster meaningful engagement, personal growth, and emotional well-being. Grounded in the integrated restorative care philosophy, these services support residents in preserving their identity, autonomy, and social functioning. Delivered within a safe, inclusive, trauma-informed, and person-centered environment, social services are tailored to meet the emotional, psychosocial, and practical needs of each resident. Services also promote dignity, purpose, and connection.
