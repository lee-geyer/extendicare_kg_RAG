# Pain - Integrated Screen and Assessment

| Resident: | Effective Date: | Location: |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Initial Admission: | Admission: | Date of Birth: |
| Score: NA | Category: NA | Physician: |

## A. Pain Screen

If the Resident can verbalize pain, complete a Numeric Pain Scale. For non-verbal or cognitively impaired Residents use the PAINAD.

1. **Most Recent Pain Level**
- Pain Level:
- Date:
- Pain Scale:

2. **What scale was used?**
- a. Numeric
- b. Painad

3. **Add pain score here - this will populate the SPN as well as the Resident assessment page.**
```
0    1   2    3    4   5    6    7    8    9   10
```

4. **Ask or investigate any historical resolved pain that should be observed for or mitigated during stay?**
- 1. Yes - history of pain
- 0. No history of pain
- 2. Pain history unknown

### Pain History

Understanding pain history will help to anticipate when pain may arise or worsen.

4b. Document discussion on pain history and determine together if mitigation plan required.

**ACTION ALERT**
Screen is Negative, further assessment not required at this time. (S)

## B. Pain Assessment

1. Use the magnifying glass to select Conditions / Chronic Illnesses:

2. **Location of Pain:**
- a. Back pain
- b. Bone pain
- c. Chest pain
- d. Headache
- e. Hip pain
- f. Joint pain (other than hip)
- g. Soft tissue pain (e.g., lesion, muscle)
- h. Abdominal pain
- i. Mouth / tooth pain
- j. Skin Injury
- k. Other

2a. **Please specify pain details:** (location, region, side etc.)

Assessment of non-verbal or cognitively impaired residents is particularly important to identify and document pain-related behaviours, pathological signs, and to adjust care planning accordingly.

**Observe for physical indications:**

2b. **Are there any visible signs of injury?** (e.g., swelling, redness, bruising, pressure, contractures, shortening or rotation of limbs)
- 1. Yes
- 0. No
