# CODE YELLOW
## Missing Resident

### What does it mean?
Code Yellow is the designated phrase used to alert staff to an incident in which a resident is considered missing. A resident is considered missing when they are not in the location where staff expect to find them.

### What do I do?

#### Stage 1:
- Search common areas.
- Check Leave of Absence books/see if resident is signed out.
- Contact family to determine if resident is with them.
- Notify Charge Nurse/Incident Manager.
- Announce 3 times, “Attention please, would (Resident’s Name) please return to (unit/program area) immediately.”

If you believe the resident to be at risk of harm (i.e., has exited the building and the weather is extremely hot or cold, the resident is known to be exit seeking, there are clinical concerns, etc.), begin Stage 3 immediately.

#### Stage 2:
- Announce 3 times, “Code Yellow, all available staff please proceed to location (command centre).”
- Search all areas of the home.
- Search external sitting areas.
- Ensure external exits are properly secured.
- Call external locations the resident may be known to frequent for information.

#### Stage 3: (Resident at risk of harm or greater than 30 minutes)
- Call 9-1-1 and report the missing person.
- Search external location within a 4-block radius of the home (report into the home by phone every 10 minutes).
- Follow direction from police.

### When the resident is found:
- Assess the resident’s condition.
- Contact the Incident Manager and EMS at 9-1-1 if necessary.
- Announce 3 times, “Code Yellow, All clear.”

### Review it before you need it:
- Refer to your Home’s Emergency Planning and Management Manual Code Yellow.
- Review the Code Yellow checklists that describe your area’s role if a missing resident emergency occurs.
