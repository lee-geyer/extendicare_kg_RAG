## POLICY

Extendicare is committed to maintaining an environment that promotes resident safety and security, independence, and quality of life, where risks are mitigated through a coordinated interdisciplinary approach in accordance with provincial standards and regulations.

### STANDARD

#### Resident Identification & Safety
- To ensure resident safety and the accurate delivery of care, treatment, or services, all employees and external healthcare providers are required to utilize a minimum of two resident identifiers prior to the provision of care.
- Identifiers will be distinct and involve a combination of personal details (e.g., name and photo ID).

#### Safe & Secure Environments
- Homes are designed to foster a safe and secure environment that supports residents’ freedom of movement while ensuring their care needs are met.
- Safety rounds will be conducted to proactively address potential safety hazards and ensure timely intervention to mitigate risk for incidents and adverse outcomes, as well as to reduce call bell usage and improve overall resident satisfaction.

#### Minimizing Heat-Related Illnesses
- A collaborative, evidence-based approach will be utilized to minimize resident risk for heat-related illness during warmer months, including education on recognizing and managing signs of heat stress and other related conditions.
- Interdisciplinary measures will include monitoring of indoor temperatures, the development of home-specific heat response plans, and the completion of heat-related illness risk screens for the development of individualized plans of care.

#### Tobacco & Cannabis Use
- The home will provide a designated, safe environment for residents who have been assessed to safely use or consume, including smoke or vape tobacco or recreational cannabis independently, in accordance with all applicable laws.
- Residents' rights to privacy and freedom of choice are respected, while ensuring the safety and well-being and comfort of all residents and staff in the home.
- Safety measures outlined in this policy will be carried out in accordance with resident assessed needs and preferences to support autonomy, while safeguarding well-being and minimizing the risk of injury to self and others.
