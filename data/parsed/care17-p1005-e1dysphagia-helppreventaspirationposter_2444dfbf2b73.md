# Help Prevent Aspiration

## Recognize Swallowing Problems

Dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, is the delay or misdirection of fluid or solid food bolus as it travels from the mouth to the stomach. This can occur at any stage of swallowing and can vary in severity from mild to severe.

### Risk Factors

- Unable to stay upright or alert for 15 minutes (e.g., over sedation, decreased LOC, confusion, delirium, etc.)
- Breathing difficulties while eating or drinking
- Unable to manage own secretions, choking, or weak cough
- Traumatic or prolonged (>48 hours) intubation or reintubation
- Tracheostomy in place
- Preexisting dysphagia
- History of aspiration pneumonia
- Structural impairment within oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, and/or esophagus (secondary to strictures, inflammation/infection, radiation therapy, trauma, burns, etc.)
- Neurological deficit (e.g., CVA, Parkinson's, Huntington's, Multiple Sclerosis, ALS, Dementia)
- Head and neck structural deficit

### Signs and Symptoms

- Refusals to eat or drink
- Pocketing of food
- Excessive or inadequate chewing
- Tears in eyes after swallowing
- Coughing or choking during or after meals
- Worsening congestion
- Complaints of pain or obstruction after swallowing
- Gurgly voice after swallowing
