## Resident Equipment Cleaning & Storage Audit Instructions

### What you need to know:
- This audit can be done by any staff member.
- This audit is a one-time “snapshot”.
- This is not an audit of housekeeping practices.
- This audit takes into consideration all potential types of Resident care equipment in use, so there may be one or more categories listed in the audit that do not apply to the area you are auditing.
- The equipment listed on the audit is not intended to be a complete list of equipment. Other common items used can be added.
- The audit results are to be used to help determine areas for improvement.
- Some improvements can be made immediately and can be done by anyone.
- Some changes will take time and require special project planning by the area. Any actions planned or taken for quality improvement measures should be discussed and documented in the Home’s Infection Prevention and Control or Quality Committees.
- All staff members should have access to both the procedure and schedule for cleaning an item. If the procedure or schedule for cleaning cannot be found, comment on it in the audit.

### Auditor’s Instructions:
- Complete the audit, documenting exactly what you see at the time of the audit.
