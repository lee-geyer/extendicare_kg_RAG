## Code Purple – Taken Hostage Tip Sheet

### When Taken Hostage
1. Remain calm, be polite, cooperate and follow instructions.
2. Do not leave unless you are certain you and anyone else with you is not in danger.
3. Hide all personal belongings such as phone, keys, name badge etc. Anything that may make your captor believe you are a person of importance or a threat.
4. Do not negotiate with the captor(s), just agree with them. Leave decision-making and/or action to resolve the situation to the police.
5. Avoid sudden movements or an aggressive / threatening stance or behaviour. Keep eye contact but do not stare at them. Try to act friendly and relaxed.
6. Do not speak unless spoken to, let your captor(s) know your name and use their name as much as possible if you know it to make a connection.
7. Meet demands with positive responses such as, “I’ll do my best”. Never say “no.”
8. Cooperate with your captor(s) and follow instructions. Do not make any suggestions to your captor(s) as they might think you plan to escape or have other motives.
9. Do not turn your back on your captor(s) unless ordered to and maintain eye contact without staring.
10. Be reassured that your fellow workers and police negotiators are doing their best to get you out safely. Be prepared to speak with police over the phone.
11. Stay low to the ground and away from windows and doors, if possible.
12. Do not attempt to fight with or disarm your captor(s) unless this is the absolute last resort and your life is in imminent danger, in which case:
- Attempt to incapacitate the captor(s) with physical aggression.
- If you are with other hostages, work as a team and use anything you can find as a weapon; fire extinguisher, chairs, tables, lamps, etc.

### Upon Arrival of Police
- DO NOT run or yell when rescue comes.
- Drop anything in your hands, take cover on the floor with your hands visible and remain still for your protection.
- Initial police response team will come in with guns and will not stop to help victims. Rescue teams will follow and will provide aid.
- Do not disturb possible evidence. This is a crime scene. Expect police questions.
