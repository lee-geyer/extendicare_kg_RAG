## How To Complete the Inspection Checklists

### Building And Equipment Maintenance Checklists

- These inspection checklists are found in the Preventative Maintenance section of this manual. They have been prepared as an easy way to list the routine preventive maintenance activities to be performed regularly. Facilities that use a computerized system can import the information from these checklists into the work orders of the automated system.
- Since checklists have been prepared for the equipment found in many different facilities, some of the listed equipment is mutually exclusive; not all of the equipment found in the checklists will be found at every home. Each home should review the list of equipment and select the checklists that correspond to the equipment found at that home. These checklists should be separate from those that are not applicable.
- It is recommended that checklists applicable to the home be kept blank and copied annually so that maintenance staff can record their maintenance records for the year on the copy of the checklist that applies to that year. These checklists, once completed, form the records that the preventive maintenance has been completed.

In order to properly complete the checklist, the following should be done:

1. The description of the equipment or room should be written at the top of the list, for example, on the Equipment Name is listed as “Make-Up Air Unit”. The location that this unit serves should be added (even if it is done in pencil or ink) so that the Equipment Name would now read “Make Up Air Unit: West Wing”.
> **Note:** If there are several make-up air units, a separate checklist would be created for each unit.

2. At the bottom of the page, there are several squares. Each time the maintenance is done, the appropriate square should be marked, either with an “X” or a checkmark.
- When the weekly maintenance is done, the “W” square should be marked;
- when the monthly maintenance is done, the “M” square should be marked;
- when the quarterly maintenance is done, the “Q” square should be marked;
- when the semi-annual maintenance is done, the “S” square should be marked;
- and when the annual maintenance is done, the “A” square should be marked.
- If for some reason maintenance is not done that month, then the appropriate square should be left blank. This provides a quick visual indication of the status of the equipment with relation to its regular preventive maintenance and allows the maintenance people to easily see if monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual maintenance has to be done.

3. There are several columns to the left side of the task list.
- i. The first column lists weekly maintenance. If that task is required to be performed on a weekly basis, an “X” is placed in the first column beside that task.
- ii. If the task is to be performed monthly, an “X” is placed in the second column beside that task. In that case, all of the weekly maintenance tasks as well as all of the monthly maintenance tasks should be done at the same time.

# How To Complete the Inspection Checklists

1. If the task is to be performed quarterly, then an “X” is placed in the third column beside that task. Then all of the weekly tasks, all of the monthly tasks, and all of the quarterly tasks should be performed at the same time.

2. If the task is to be performed on a semi-annual basis, then an “X” is placed in the fourth column beside that task. Then all of the weekly tasks, all of the monthly tasks, all of the quarterly tasks, and all of the semi-annual tasks should be performed at the same time.

3. If the task is to be performed on an annual basis, then an “X” is placed in the fifth column beside that task. Then all of the weekly tasks, all of the monthly tasks, all of the quarterly tasks, all of the semi-annual tasks, and all of the annual tasks should be performed at the same time.

4. Once a series of tasks has been completed (such as the monthly tasks), then the person who carried out the maintenance should write on the back page of the form that the work was done. To complete this form, the tasks completed should be listed under the “Item” column, the work done should be described in the description section, and the line should be initialed and dated. As an example, the item column would read “1 to 9” and the description would say “Monthly maintenance completed”. The line would then be initialed and dated by the person who did the maintenance. Similarly, for the quarterly maintenance, the line would read “1 to 11”… “Quarterly Maintenance Completed”. The initial and date are significant to determine if the work is compliant with regulatory requirements. A form that has not been initialed and dated is often considered to be invalid.

5. The back of the form is also a good place to keep track of any other information relating to the maintenance of the equipment. For example, one line could read “drive belt changed” with the date and signature. This provides an easy way to see when any major maintenance work was done.

6. The “Key” column is used to provide an easy way to draw attention to issues. If everything is OK, then write “OK” in that column. If there is something that should be monitored, write “Note” or put an asterisk (*) in that column so that it can be observed during the next maintenance visit.

When completing a given checklist, the maintenance person should note any significant repairs or adjustments that cannot be conveniently performed during the regular maintenance procedure. Such significant items, especially those requiring outside help (new parts, etc.) should be entered on the Maintenance Request Log and handled as per the procedure outlined in the Maintenance Request Log section within the Maintenance Documentation section.
