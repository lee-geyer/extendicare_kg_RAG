## POLICY
### Privacy and Confidentiality Program

### DEFINITION
**Circle of Care** - Health care providers (“HCP”s) providing assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and services to a resident. The personal health information (“PHI”) of a resident may be shared with these HCPs so long as it is required to support their health services to the individual.

### PROCEDURE
#### Consent
Extendicare relies on the consent of the resident for collection, use, and disclosure of PHI for purposes other than those listed in the Collection, Use and Disclosure procedure. Consent must be informed, voluntary, and given by the resident the information is about.

There are two types of consent - express consent and implied consent:
- **a.** Express consent can be provided verbally, in writing, or electronically, and can be withdrawn at any time by the resident. Ensure all verbal express consents are recorded as part of the resident’s record.
- **b.** HCPs can assume a resident’s implied consent to use and disclose their PHI within the resident’s circle of care and only as long as that information will be used to provide health care or services to that resident.

Express consent is required for the disclosure of PHI to a person or organization that is not another HCP, or for purposes other than providing health services.

#### Consent on Behalf of Incapable or Deceased Residents
If a resident is deemed incapable of providing, withholding, or withdrawing their consent, their substitute decision maker (SDM) may make a decision about the resident’s PHI on their behalf. The SDM’s identity and authority must first be verified.

If a resident is deceased, the deceased resident’s rights with respect to their PHI may be exercised on their behalf by a person authorized to administer the estate of the deceased (i.e., estate trustee/legal representative). The identity and authority of the estate trustee, or the person that has assumed responsibility for the administration of the deceased’s estate, must be validated before any action may be taken with respect to the deceased resident’s PHI (e.g., will, court order, personal identification).

# PROCEDURE

## SECTION: Privacy and Confidentiality
### DESCRIPTION: Consent and Consent Directive
### INDEX: PRV1-P10.02

Residents have a right to use a consent directive to restrict Extendicare from accessing, using, or sharing their PHI for the purpose of providing or assisting in the provision of health care.

### Withdrawal of Consent and Express Instructions (Consent Directives)

A resident may withdraw or change their consent previously given to Extendicare to collect, use, or disclose their PHI. A resident may provide an express instruction, or a consent directive, to limit or stop disclosure of their PHI to certain persons or entities or for certain purposes, including:

- a. to other HCPs for the purpose of providing health and support services to the resident;
- b. to contact family members or friends of the resident, when the resident is incapacitated or injured; or
- c. to family or friends of the resident, when the information is limited to location and general and current health status of the resident.

Residents may provide a consent directive verbally or in writing. Ensure all consent directives are recorded as part of the resident’s record. When a resident withdraws consent or provides express instructions, Extendicare is not required to destroy or attempt to retrieve PHI collected, used, or disclosed before the withdrawal or express instructions.
