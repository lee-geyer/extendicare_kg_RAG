# INTRODUCTION

Patient lifts can reduce work-related caregiver injuries. For many years, the use of mechanical lifting equipment (in addition to other assistive patient handling devices) has been a key component of safe patient handling or caregiver injury programs.¹ A biomechanical laboratory study and psychophysical evaluation showed that mechanical lifts²:

- Reduce the back-compressive forces on nursing personnel by an estimated 60%
- Remove two-thirds of the lifting activities per transfer
- Increase the residents’ perceptions of comfort and security, as compared with being manually lifted

An Occupational Health Safety Network study found that, of the 62% of injuries that included data on lifting equipment, almost 83% of the injuries occurred when lifting equipment was not used, while only 18% of the injuries occurred when equipment was used.³

### Patient Handling Injuries

Among all healthcare personnel at 112 U.S healthcare facilities participating in OHNS, 2012–2014:

The benefits of using mechanical lifting equipment and sling-assisted transfers are widely accepted, but for healthcare facilities to achieve best practice in their use can be challenging. There is a wide variety of options and configurations of lift and sling systems available to meet the many needs of individual patients throughout different care activities. Whilst the variety and flexibility of options are hugely beneficial in terms of safety, efficiency, and comfort, many careful choices need to be made to avoid the potential for confusion and incorrect practice.

This document has been designed to support in selecting, sizing, and fitting slings correctly and appropriately for both the patient, the care activity, and the device to be used to promote best practice throughout the care workflow.

# Empowering Movement with Assistive Devices

## Supporting Safety in Sling Selection, Sizing, and Fitting

While often seen as ‘passive’ devices, the variety of slings and lifts available today provides the perfect foundation for maximizing functional mobility and optimizing mobility moments around the clock, throughout the care pathway.

During the rehabilitation process, mobility assistive technologies can be seen as a ‘mobility partner’ to facilitate functional mobility, promote patient safety, and reduce caregiver injury, which is supported by best practice guidelines.

### Challenges and Risks

The benefits of sling-assisted transfers are widely accepted, but this is not without potential risk of injury and discomfort to the patient and the caregiver. There are many challenges for healthcare facilities to achieve safety in the use of these devices, and the risks associated need to be acknowledged.

Therapists have reported that patient handling equipment actually increased their options for therapeutic activities and allowed them to mobilize patients earlier in the rehabilitation process compared to not having the equipment available.

This document outlines the importance of proper sling selection and application in the context of patient mobility and caregiver safety. It emphasizes the need for training and awareness of the risks involved in using assistive devices.

# Key Considerations for Best Practice

Patient assessment is crucial to identify the most appropriate equipment for the care task, including selection and fitting of the appropriate sling. In this section, four main areas to consider will be described in more detail.

## 1. Patient Characteristics
- **Condition and specific needs**
- **Size, morphology, weight**
- **Mobility level**

## 2. Care Activity
- **Aim and nature of care task**
- **Efficiency**
- **Rehab goals**

## 3. Lift System
- **Intended use and compatibility**
- **Spreader bar and sling attachment**
- **Sling fabric option**

## 4. Sizing and Fitting
- **Sizing**
- **Fitting**
- **Visual indicators (fitting cues)**

----

Bariatric slings are designed specifically to support individual needs of plus size patients with varying body types. It is just as important to ensure that slings support smaller patients safely and comfortably.

### Mobility Level
Empowering or maintaining the mobility level of the patient is crucial in preventing deconditioning and reducing the risk of immobility acquired conditions. Assessing the mobility level of the patient is a leading indicator of the type of lift and sling to be used. Ambulation, standing, and transfer slings will support patients with semi-active mobility levels to be as functionally mobile as possible and can support with rehab activities/goals. Passive slings can also be used to support seated activities and to assist the caregiver to transfer or reposition the patient when entirely passive.

----

### Consider the following when assessing patient characteristics:

- **Condition and specific needs**: Some conditions may lead to additional discomfort and pain, for example, or the need for specific support. Additional padding from a sling may be required or specific support in areas such as head, neck, or hips. If there are surgical wounds or skin damage present, consider where the sling will fit and if it will dislodge dressings or cause discomfort.

- **In situ slings** are designed to provide additional comfort whilst remaining under the patient in sitting.

- **Toileting slings** allow good access for hygiene care but require some trunk control to prevent the risk of falling through the aperture.

- **Active standing/transfer sling with Sera Flex** promotes mobility and can help to support rehab activities.

- **Stretcher sling** supporting passive, supine repositioning can help to support rehab activities and lateral transfers.

# Care Activity

## Aim and Nature of Care Task
There are many different types of slings available not only to meet the specific requirements of the patient but also to cover a wide range of care and/or rehabilitation activities, providing support throughout the patient journey. In combination with the patient’s mobility level assessment, consider the activity to be carried out e.g. repositioning, seated transfer, standing, walking, hygiene or rehab activity to help in selecting the appropriate sling and lift device.

> **Bathing sling enables out-of-bed hygiene care.**

## Efficiency
Efficiency in the care process is vital in today’s healthcare environment, with limited resources and time available. Selecting the right device and sling for the care activity can help to reduce the number of caregivers required and promote single-handed care. Leaving a repositioning sling in place may help to increase efficiency and reduce caregiver effort by reducing the number of transfers required and having the sling always at the point of care.

> **Repositioning slings left in place (where appropriate) can help to maximize efficiency in the workflow and reduce caregiver effort.**

## Rehab Goals
Preventing functional decline and empowering patient mobility are key to avoiding immobility acquired conditions. Many slings can support rehabilitation activities early in the recovery process such as repositioning slings to encourage in-bed mobility. Seated transfer and standing slings not only provide a safe way for the patient to move, but can also be used to support rehab goals such as sitting at the edge of the bed or developing dynamic sitting balance. Standing and walking slings support the patient with ambulation and other activities of living aimed at improving function.

> **Active lift systems promote safe rehabilitation and mobility activities.**

# Sling Selection and Application

## Lift System

### Intended Use and Compatibility
Slings are a fundamental part of a lift/transfer system. They attach to a specific device to work in unison to complete the transfer. These include ceiling lifts, floor lifts and standing and rising aids. It is essential in line with International guidelines to ensure a sling is being used according to its intended use and in combination with a compatible lift. These are both in the Instructions for Use document to ensure safety of the patient and caregiver.

> **When using lift systems, the safe working load (SWL) of all components of the lift system (sling, lift, spreader bar) must be considered.**

> **An Arjo clip attachment sling with the compatible Arjo clip spreader bar.**

### Spreader Bar and Sling Attachment
There are many different spreader bar options available with the different lift devices. The sling attachment type varies, the most common ones being clip and loop systems. Clip slings in combination with a dynamic positioning system allow the patient's position in the sling to be adjusted from reclined to sitting. Conversely, loop slings offer a choice of positions to be chosen at the point the sling is connected to the spreader bar. Colour coded loops can support with consistency of loop choice. Considering the required position of the patient is important before selecting the loop option. Understanding the differing systems is therefore essential to ensure safety and comfort of the patient.

> **Clip sling with dynamic positioning system.**
> **Loop sling with hook spreader bar.**

### Sling Fabric Option
Slings can be launderable (re-used for different patients), disposable (patient specific) or wipeable. This provides facilities with options to meet their infection prevention and sustainability policies in the most cost-effective way. There are different launderable fabric options specific to the care situation like mesh fabrics for bathing slings and special fabrics for in situ slings and comfort repositioning slings that are suitable to remain under the patient.

> **Sling fabric choices for different care tasks and facility needs.**

This document is structured to provide clear guidance on the selection and application of slings in patient care, ensuring safety, efficiency, and support for rehabilitation goals.

# Sizing and Fitting

## Sizing
Following the sling Instructions for Use is vital to ensure the size and fit of the sling is correct for the patient and the care activity it is being used for. Arjo provides clear and detailed guidance to support this within their Instructions for Use documentation.

Measuring should take into account the patient’s size, weight distribution, and body shape, in addition to their weight. Arjo provides guidance on where and how to measure the patient for the various types of slings provided.

### Arjo Sizing Guidelines
Arjo provides colour-coded guidelines specific to sling type to support accurate sizing and selection. These guidelines show where to measure the patient and how this is used to find the correct size (example for Passive loop slings below).

1. Measure from the patient’s coccyx/seat (A) to top of the head.
2. Measure the patient’s low hip circumference, B.
3. Follow the sizing chart below to pick the correct size.

| Top of head to coccyx (cm) | 65-71 (25.5-28) | 72-79 (28.5-31) | 80-85 (31.5-33.5) | 86-93 (34-36.5) | 94-105 (37-41.5) |
|-----------------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Low hip circumference (cm)  |                  |                  |                    |                  |                   |
| 79-99 (31-39.5)            | S                | M                | L                  | L                | /                 |
| 100-116 (40-45.5)          | M                | M                | L                  | XL               | XXL               |
| 117-133 (46-52.5)          | M                | L                | L                  | XL               | XXL               |
| 134-154 (53-60.5)          | L                | XL               | XL                 | XL               | XXL               |
| 155-170 (61-67)            | /                | XXL              | XXL                | XXL              | XXL               |

A seated transfer sling can be introduced behind the patient using a slide sheet underneath the legs to help guide the leg sections of the sling into place underneath around each thigh using a slide sheet for ease but also to reduce risk of friction and shear on the skin.

## Fitting
Once the correct type and size of sling has been selected, it is important to ensure it is applied or ‘fitted’ to the patient accurately. The application method of the sling will vary according to the type of sling and the position of the patient when fitting, and should follow the guidance in the Instructions for Use. Typically, slings are fitted when the patient is seated, at the edge of the bed or in a lying (supine) position (on the bed/stretcher/floor).

A sling may be fitted with the patient in a side lying position (rolling method). This can also be used for fitting a sling on the floor. Standing/transfer and ambulation slings may be fitted whilst the patient supports themselves at the edge of the bed.

----

**Note:** This document is part of the Arjo Instructions for Use and should be reviewed regularly to ensure compliance with best practices.

# Visual Indicators (Fitting Cues)

Once the sling is fitted to the patient, it is essential to use ‘visual indicators’ to check that the sling has been fitted properly. These vary according to the sling type, intended for additional guidance to support assessment. If the sling does not fit according to the indicators, or there are other concerns, further assessment is required. Visual indicators include:

| Sling Type                          | Visual Indicators                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Amputee, Toilet, Passive            | - The sling attachment points at shoulders and legs should be clear of the body and have enough reach to attach to the spreader bar.
- The leg sections of the sling should be long enough to reach around the patient's mid thigh to support well.
- The patient's upper body should be inside the coloured edging of the sling.
- The patient's head should be well supported by the sling (if head support sling used). |
| Active Slings for SARA Lifts       | - The sling attachment points should be forward of the body and have enough reach to attach to the spreader bar.                                                                                               |
| Stretcher Slings                    | - The sling attachment points at shoulders and legs should be clear of the body and have enough reach to attach to the spreader bar.
- The patient's upper body should be inside the edging of the sling.
- The patient's head should be well supported by the sling. |
| Ambulation Slings                   | - The sling attachment points at shoulders and legs should be clear of the body and have enough reach to attach to the spreader bar.
- Check with patient to ensure a comfortable fit.
- Waist belt should fit snugly and comfortably around the patient.
- Ensure there is enough clearance between the patient's head and spreader bar to avoid contact while standing. |

### Sling Size and Fit Assessment
- The sling size and fit is appropriate for the patient.
- The sling is too small with a risk of discomfort and lack of support.
- The sling is too big with a risk of the patient falling through the aperture.
- The sling has not been fitted correctly leaving the patient without head support.

# Maintaining Safety in Sling Use

## Further Support from Arjo

Arjo has a number of resources available to assist facilities in consistent and correct sling selection and application including:

- **Arjo MOVE** – Arjo MOVE programs are designed to work in partnership with a facility to embed cultural change in patient handling. Insight assessments help the customer to identify current challenges and care choices, enabling recommendations for best practice. MOVE clinicians support caregivers by equipping them with the necessary skills to become ambassadors in safe patient handling and mobility practices within their facility. This program is based on the fundamental principle of optimizing mobility of patients and residents, while reducing caregiver risk and avoiding immobility acquired conditions.

- **Sling Instructions for Use (IFUs)** – There are IFUs for each type of sling, which include all the necessary information to ensure safe use of the device.

- **Additional Quick Reference Guides (QRGs)** – These are short summaries of the key elements of the IFU, to act as a reminder, but should always be read in conjunction with the IFU.

- **Sling Selector Tool** – This is a web-based tool on arjo.com to assist in the selection of the right sling(s) for patients and the care task.

- **Sling Technical Reference Guide** – This document provides a detailed overview of Arjo slings available.

- **Clinical application and demonstration videos** – These assist in understanding the sling use and its clinical application in practice during the care workflow.

## Safety Checks and Regular Inspection

Regular inspection should include checks before and after use and after laundering. Some regulations require that these checks should be documented at least once every six months. Some facilities choose to use tagging systems carried out during full service schedules of slings and the lift devices.

### Key Checks Include:

- Checking the attachment clip of the sling.
- Checking the sling strap and loop attachment for fraying and loose stitching.
- Checking that seams are not showing signs of damage or deterioration.
- Checking that the label is readable and valid for use.

## Training

Facilities must have training programs in place and should incorporate lift system training during these programs. Some may decide to standardize their lift device systems and sling types to increase efficiency and reduce the number of different devices available, with the ultimate aim of promoting consistency in practice and streamlining training. This can help to reduce the occurrence of adverse incidents.
