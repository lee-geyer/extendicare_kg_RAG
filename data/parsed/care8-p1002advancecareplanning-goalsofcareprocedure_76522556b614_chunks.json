If unavailable, verbal wishes related to CPR and Goals of Care must be obtained and documented in the resident's health record and reviewed annually during the resident’s care conference.2. Residents who are cognitively intact will be encouraged to participate in the “My Care My Voice” advance care planning discussion within the Palliative Assessment to express their values and beliefs, informing their plan of care prior to the 6-week interdisciplinary team conference (IDTC).3.",
