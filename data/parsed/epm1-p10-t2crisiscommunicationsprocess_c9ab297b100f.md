## Crisis Communications Process

### Introduction
This process provides definitions of levels of risk and communication protocols to follow in crisis situations in order to minimize confusion and inform our stakeholders of necessary information.

### Definition of a Risk
Risk for this purpose is defined as any incident which may actually or potentially threaten the health and safety of residents or staff as well as Extendicare’s reputation, with potential for and significant loss of community, customer and investor or employee confidence.

### Four Levels of a Risk

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Stage 1: Low** | An event has occurred at a home that has not resulted in serious injury to residents or staff and poses minimal threat to Extendicare’s reputation/operation. Only one home is affected and there is little to no potential for media coverage.
**Example:** An elevator in a home breaks down. |
| **Stage 2: Moderate** | A home-specific issue has occurred but poses no immediate risk of occurring at another home. The event or issue poses a potential threat to resident safety and Extendicare’s reputation/operations. There is potential for broader media coverage.
**Example:** A mechanical lift or sling, used in the majority of homes, malfunctions and causes a non-life threatening injury to a resident. |
| **Stage 3: High** | An incident has occurred that may harm or has the potential to harm residents or staff, affect operations, and/or severely damage the company’s reputation. The issue may pose a potential risk to numerous homes and media coverage is expected.
**Examples:** Physical assault to resident/employee; resident elopement in bad weather; inclement weather is preventing food deliveries and power outages are being experienced. |
| **Stage 4: Critical** | A major crisis which has already caused harm to residents and/or staff, affected operations, and/or severely damaged the company’s reputation. Media has been contacting the home(s) and/or corporate office.
**Example:** A resident dies as a result of asphyxiation from a restraint; resident is seriously injured; sexual assault of a resident; an explosion, gas leak or fire is forcing the immediate evacuation of the home. |

# Crisis Communications Process

## Incident Management Communication Team Organization And Structure

The crisis communications process aligns with the Emergency Response Plan. The Incident Manager will assume primary responsibility for determining the level of risk facing the organization. The Incident Manager will determine the need to call the IMS Team/specific members. An IMS Team will be organized by the Incident Manager at the onset of a Stage 3: High or Stage 4: Critical.

The roles on the team will be consistent with the IMS Model. The people that fill those roles may vary so that the team has the expertise to properly manage the crisis/issue at hand. The roles on the IMS Team include the following:

- Incident Manager
- Communication Officer
- Liaison Officer
- Safety / Health and Wellness Officer
- Information Technology Lead
- IPAC Lead
- Resident Care Lead
- Operations Chief
- Planning Chief
- Logistics Chief
- Finance Chief

> **Note:** The role of Planning Chief will be assumed by an individual with a nursing background. A Senior Operations designate will be assigned to the IMS Team at the Stage 3 level.

## Dealing With Ascending Levels of Risk

**Definition:** An event has occurred at a home that has not resulted in serious injury to residents or staff and poses minimal threat to Extendicare’s reputation/operation. Only one home is affected and there is little to no potential for media coverage.

### Involvement:

- Incident Manager (Executive Director or designate at the home level)
- Manager, Corporate Communications
- The Regional Director responsible for the impacted home
- The Long-Term Care (Nursing) Consultant for the home
- Director of Operations
- Director, SGP (if necessary)
- Environmental Consultant (if necessary)

# Crisis Communications Process

## Risk Management Communications Process for Regional Directors

1. RD and Communications receive notification from home regarding potential issue.
2. RD determines level of risk based on 4 stages outlined in Crisis Communications Process.
3. RD sends Issue Alert as per Issue Alert process.
4. If stage 3 or 4, the Issue Alert should suggest members of the Corporate Incident Management System (IMS) Team (always including Corporate Communications).
5. If a Corporate IMS Team is to be enacted (stages 3 or 4), the Regional Director should facilitate a teleconference with the available suggested members of the IMS Team.
