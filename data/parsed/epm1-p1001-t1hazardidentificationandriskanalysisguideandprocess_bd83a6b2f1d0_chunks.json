      "text": "Interviews with subject matter experts and review of existing emergency plans is an effective way to make this assessment.Where it is deemed that new risk management strategies are required, it is recommended that actions be taken to reduce risk working from hazards of highest priority to lowest priority. Where possible, however, an all-hazards approach to mitigation and preparedness should be taken, where the relative risk of multiple hazards can be reduced by a single measure (for example, an extreme weather plan could cover tornados, hurricanes, and severe storms).### Ways to Decrease Risk\nThere are two ways of decreasing risk:\n- Reducing the likelihood\n- Reducing the consequencesBoth likelihood and consequence reduction can be achieved through mitigation measures (such as redundancies in case of failure or built-in physical resistance to prevent damage). Consequences can further be reduced through preparedness measures that allow for a more efficient response (such as written plans to guide response, staff training to ensure response is executed effectively, and resource acquisition to support response).### Primary Ways to Limit Risk\nThere are three primary ways to limit risk from hazardous materials or situations:",

The protective barrier could be the type of construction of a building, personal protective equipment, etc., dependent on the hazard being addressed. An option used by emergency officials is called “sheltering in place” where the building envelope is used as a barrier to protect the occupants. For example, it may be safer to remain indoors than to venture outside into a potential hazardous environment.In protecting the general population, the most common form of reducing risk is distance created by evacuating an area around the hazard.",
