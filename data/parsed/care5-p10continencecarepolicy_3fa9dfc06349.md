## POLICY

Extendicare is dedicated to delivering an interdisciplinary, person-centred approach in the continence care with residents. The focus is on promoting independence, management, comfort, and dignity of all residents, in accordance with provincial regulatory requirements and best practice.

----

## STANDARD

- Continence status will be assessed upon move-in and with any change in the resident’s continence status. This will include prevention and management of altered bladder and bowel function, evaluation of the type of incontinence, identifying contributing factors, and the consideration of the impact on resident’s physical, emotional and social well-being.

- An individualized continence plan of care will be developed for residents based on their needs, preferences, and health conditions. This personalized plan will be reviewed and revised with any change in continence care needs.

- The interdisciplinary team in a collaborative effort will ensure that residents utilizing continence products remain clean, dry, and comfortable and that care is provided in a manner that respects the residents’ dignity, privacy, and autonomy.

- Continence products will be used according to the resident’s needs and procured through the preferred vendor. They will not be utilized as an alternative to toileting.

- Targeted interdisciplinary interventions will be implemented to support the promotion of continence, the prevention of bowel dysfunction, and to mitigate complications (i.e., skin breakdown, pain, infection). Interventions may include, but are not limited to, restorative programming, nutrition, and hydration protocols.

- The continence team will collaborate with the interdisciplinary team members and consult with the preferred vendor to ensure a comprehensive plan is developed and referrals initiated when specialized assessment or treatment may be required.

- The home will designate a regulated healthcare professional as a continence lead and back up. This professional will collaborate with the interdisciplinary team to ensure the management of continence according to evidence-based guidelines.

- The DOC/ADOC or designate will oversee the continence program and conduct an annual program evaluation to ensure compliance with the standards set out in the policy and procedure.
