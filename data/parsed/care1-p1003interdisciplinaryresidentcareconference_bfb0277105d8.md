## Procedure
Extendicare is committed to providing supportive, holistic care conferences that foster open communication and meaningful engagement with residents, families, and care teams, ensuring personalized care that respects dignity and individual needs.

- An Interdisciplinary Resident Care Conference (IDRCC) will be facilitated within:
- **ON and AB:** six weeks of move-in
- **MB:** six to eight weeks of move-in
- This is in compliance with legislative and jurisdictional requirements. It will occur annually thereafter and as required.

- An annual IDRCC schedule will be maintained and shared with the resident/SDM/POA and interdisciplinary team. The resident/SDM/POA or designated individual will be formally invited in writing to the move-in and annual IDRCC, with a reminder call made the Friday prior. Efforts will be made in advance to ensure their availability and preferences are accommodated, including options to reschedule or participate remotely.

- Prior to the IDRCC, each department will gather all necessary assessments and relevant documentation to contribute to a detailed discussion of the resident’s care needs. During the conference, the team will collectively assess the resident’s plan of care and will be updated to reflect the outcomes of the conference.

- The designated lead will introduce the interdisciplinary team members and outline the purpose of the conference.

- The IDRCC will prioritize the resident/SDM/POA, ensuring they can express their needs, concerns, and preferences, and actively contribute to their goals and plan of care in a supportive environment.

- The resident/SDM/POA will receive a copy of the Plan of Care at their request.

- A record of the IDRCC will be maintained, including the date, participants in attendance, and the outcomes of the conference.
