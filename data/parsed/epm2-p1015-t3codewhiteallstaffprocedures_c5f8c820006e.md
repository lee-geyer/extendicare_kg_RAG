## Code White All Staff Checklist

### Respond
- If you are in a situation with an aggressive individual or a resident who is exhibiting responsive behaviours concerning for risk of harm, try to verbally de-escalate or redirect the situation. Give the person space. If there are multiple staff members at the scene, have one staff member attempt to de-escalate the situation while the other staff member stands behind to assist in removing the speaking staff member from any direct contact as needed. It is best if only one staff member is talking and trying to de-escalate so they do not further agitate or confuse the aggressive individual.
- If the aggressive individual can be calmed, a Code White does not need to be announced, the “All Clear” will be in effect.
- Review Tool 2, De-escalation Techniques for assistance on how to de-escalate an aggressive situation.
- Never physically confront the agitated or aggressive individual; use action-oriented verbal communication and non-violent interventions to de-escalate the situation safely. Do not try to remove a weapon or subdue the person.
- If you are in a situation where you feel threatened, your life is in danger, there is a possibility of an escalation of violence, the individual has a weapon (initiate Code Silver) and/or the individual has taken a hostage (initiate Code Purple), remove yourself from the confrontation and immediately call 9-1-1. Provide as much information as possible about the situation to the police.
- Advise the Incident Manager, if possible, of the Code White situation. If the Incident Manager is not in proximity, advise a staff bystander of the Code White, identifying the location, and if a weapon is involved.
- Ask the staff designate to notify the Incident Manager and ensure the Code White is announced.
- If you are in the immediate area, and/or responding to the Code White, assist in evacuating residents from the area of threat, if necessary. Follow instructions from The Incident Manager. The Incident Manager may instruct you to return to your duties once the situation is under control.
- Follow all instructions from any emergency services upon their arrival.

### Recover
When the Incident Manager or emergency services informs the Code White has ended and you hear the “all clear” announced:
- Return to regular job responsibilities.
1. Complete a written report of the incident details and submit to the Executive Director/Designate before leaving the home.
2. Attend and participate in the debrief held by the Incident Manager and Executive Director/Designate.
- If the incident involved a resident and you are involved in the residents’ care, assist the registered nursing staff to identify triggers for the resident’s behaviours to update the plan of care.
