## Point of Care Risk Assessment (PCRA)
**Policy Number:** IC-02-01-01 A1

Prior to every resident interaction, staff must assess the infectious risk posed to themselves and other residents, visitors, and staff by a resident, situation, or procedure. The PCRA is an evaluation of the risk factors related to the interaction between the staff, the resident, and the residentâ€™s environment to assess and analyze their potential for exposure to infectious agents and identify risks for transmission.

A PCRA must be conducted at the start of each staff and resident interaction to:

1. **Evaluate the likelihood of exposure to blood and body fluids:**
- Blood and body fluids are defined as any blood or bloody body fluid/tissue, including:
- Vaginal secretions
- Seminal secretions
- Cerebral spinal fluid
- Synovial fluid
- Pleural fluid
- Peritoneal fluid
- Pericardial fluid
- Amniotic fluid
- Non-bloody saliva and tears
- Nasal secretions
- Sputum
- Sweat
- Vomitus
- Urine
- Feces
- From a specific interaction (e.g., performing/assisting with aerosol-generating medical procedures, other clinical procedures/interaction, non-clinical interaction, transporting residents, direct face-to-face interaction with residents, etc.)
- With a specific resident (e.g., residents not capable of self-care/hand hygiene, have poor compliance with respiratory hygiene, copious respiratory secretions, frequent cough/sneeze, early stage of influenza-like illness, etc.)
- In a specific environment (e.g., single rooms, shared rooms/washrooms, hallway, emergency departments, public areas, therapeutic departments, diagnostic imaging departments, housekeeping, etc.)
- Under available conditions (e.g., air exchanges in a large resident area or in an airborne infection isolation room, resident lounges, etc.)

2. **Choose the appropriate actions/PPE needed to minimize the risk of resident, staff, visitor, contractor, etc. exposure to infectious agents.**
- Appropriate actions include consideration of:
- Hand Hygiene
- Use of additional precautions as required
- Accommodation selection
- Environmental/Equipment cleaning
- Resident ambulation/transportation
- PPE includes consideration for the use of:
- Gloves
- Gowns
- Masks/Respirators
- Eye/Face protection

PCRA is not a new concept, but one that is already performed regularly by staff many times a day for their safety and the safety of residents and others in the healthcare environment. For example, when a staff member assesses a resident and situation to determine the possibility of blood or body fluid exposure or chooses appropriate PPE to care for a resident with an infectious disease, these actions are both activities of a PCRA.
