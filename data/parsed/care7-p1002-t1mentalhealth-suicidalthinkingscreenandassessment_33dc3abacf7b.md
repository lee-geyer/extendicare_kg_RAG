## E. Plan of Care Considerations

After assessment completed

1. Based on answers provided by those interviewed to inform the Plan of Care may include, but not limited to: (S)
- a. For suicidal thinking but NO immediate concern for resident safety:
- Consider interdisciplinary discussion, including Physician/Nurse Practitioner, to explore if inpatient psychiatry hospitalization and/or external psychiatry/geriatric-psychiatry would be appropriate for residents with suicidal thinking.

- Consider assessment for worsening symptoms of a mood disorder (as these can increase risk of suicidal thinking).
- c. For suspicion of worsening physical illness/functional decline:
- Assess for worsening physical illness/functional decline with consideration of physical examination and diagnostic investigations to look for underlying issues that can contribute to worsening mental health symptoms.
- d. For suspicion of delirium:
- Assess for acute confusion/delirium using the Mental Health – Confusion Assessment Method (CAM).
- e. For suspicion of self-harm:
- Conduct skin integrity assessment (to assess for impairment of skin resulting from a mental health symptom, i.e., cutting).
- f. For suspicion if stockpiling medications:
- Medication administration assessment for residents who self-administer their medications (if concern for stockpiling medications).
- g. For suspicion of possession of items that may lead to harm:
- Assess for environmental risks/safety measures in resident’s room (if there is concern the resident may have possession of items that can be used to attempt self-harm or harm to others, follow regional/provincial legislation and regulations, check with your home leadership for help as required).
- h. When further assessment is required for addictions/substance use:

----

# Mental Health - Suicidal Thinking Screen and Assessment

## Resident:
- Assess for additions/substance use or misuse with the interdisciplinary team and/or external resources (as substance abuse increases risk for suicidal thinking)

- When non-pharmacological approaches to support mood/behaviour have been exhausted:
- Consult with Physician/Nurse Practitioner/Pharmacist for assessment of medication management when non-pharmacological approaches to support mood/behaviour have been exhausted with considerations for side effects and drug-drug interactions
- When more information about the resident/resident’s lived experience is required:
- Consult collateral sources of resident information, such as interdisciplinary team members, family/friends for a more complete assessment of person-centred interventions based on the resident’s lived experience (with consent from the resident/SDM)
