## The Incident Management System

IMS is an expandable system based on functions. Each function is assessed to see if it is required for the incident. A function may be fulfilled by one person or a team of people. For smaller events, one person may fulfill multiple functions. The Incident Manager determines the need to appoint a person(s) to be responsible for a function or multiple functions or can maintain responsibility for a function or functions themselves.

### Key Actions for the Functions

#### Incident Manager
- Organizes and directs the emergency response and operations for the emergency/incident as well as authorizes evacuation if required.
- The Incident Manager must provide a comprehensive briefing to the new incoming Incident Manager before passing on the function.
- All other IMS Team members must be informed of any change in the Incident Manager or any other IMS functional responsibility.

In longer events (more than 2 hours), the Incident Manager will schedule regular meetings of the IMS Team to:
1. Obtain a status update;
2. Gather information, assess challenges/needs;
3. Make decisions on the strategic direction of the response, assign tasks; and
4. Ensure effective communications.

#### Operations
Operations is the function of carrying out the emergency response, containment, damage mitigation, recovery, and directives of the Incident Manager/designate. Where the incident directly impacts resident care, Operations will coordinate and ensure ongoing resident care during emergency operations.

#### Logistics
Logistics is the function of organizing and supplying additional staffing, maintaining the physical environment, food, water, and supplies to support Operations. It is also responsible for maintaining environmental services of the physical building. Logistics will also conduct or collect information for damage assessments of the home.

#### Planning
The planning function develops scenario/resource projections for the IMS Team and undertakes long-range planning (more than 2 hours).

#### Finance/Administration
The Administration/Financial function monitors the utilization of financial assets, provides administrative support to the senior IMS Team members, and ensures documentation of all meetings.

#### Public Information
The Public Information function organizes communications with the families, stakeholders, and the media (as appropriate), and provides information updates. The Public Information Officer must work closely with Corporate Communications, or the role may be filled directly by Corporate Communications.

#### Liaison
Liaison is the function of communications and acts as the contact for representatives from other agencies.
