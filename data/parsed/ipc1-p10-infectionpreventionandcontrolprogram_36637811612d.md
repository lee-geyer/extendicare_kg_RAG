## POLICY
Homes will be committed to delivering a standardized, effective Infection Prevention and Control Program that meets the mandate and goal to decrease health care-associated infections and improve health care safety.

## STANDARD
There is an interdisciplinary Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) Committee to provide continuing support for the organization's IPAC Program. The membership of the home’s IPAC Committee will be as per legislative requirements governing the home.

An IPAC program is in place in each home to monitor and minimize the risk of infections and outbreaks. Components of the IPAC program will include:

1. Training and Education
2. Hand Hygiene Program
3. Personal Protective Equipment
4. Routine practices and Additional Precautions
5. Ethical framework and application of the precautionary principle
6. Practices for Environmental cleaning and disinfecting processes
7. Immunization/Screening for tuberculosis (TB) for all Residents and employees
8. System for detection, investigation, and control of health care-associated outbreaks
9. Surveillance based on systematic data collection to identify infections, subsequent analysis, and timely dissemination of results
10. Reportable disease reporting to public health authorities as applicable

A designated Infection Control professional/designate will oversee and coordinate the principal functions of the IPAC program at each home.

Each home will have an Interdisciplinary IPAC Committee in place which meets quarterly or more frequently based on the infectious diseases or outbreaks in the home.

The Infection Control Professional/designate will engage with Resident Council and Family Council, at least quarterly, to seek advice on IPAC measures and their impacts on Residents, Families, and Caregivers.

Each home will have an IPAC Continuous Quality Improvement and Evaluation process.

The Executive Director/Administrator will support the Infection Control Professional with their role profile.

**Ontario ONLY:** As per the FLTCA, the Infection Control Professional will ensure their contact information is shared with the local public health unit and, where one is available, with the local health authority.
