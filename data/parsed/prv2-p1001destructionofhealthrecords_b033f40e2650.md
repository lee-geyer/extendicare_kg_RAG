## POLICY

### Health Record Management

## PROCEDURE

The Head Office/Executive Director/Director of Care or Delegate will:

- Ensure there is a person delegated in the home who is responsible for supervising the destruction of health records.
- Designate a manager or staff member to pull the files that have passed the period of health record retention and destroy annually. Refer to the Health Records Retention Table tool.
- Ensure worksheets or other informal information regarding residents is discarded on an ongoing basis rather than maintained in the health care record. This information should be discarded in a manner that ensures a resident's confidentiality and privacy are not compromised. Refer to the Guidelines for Culling Records tool.
- Ensure when any electronic records on storage mechanisms (e.g., hard drives, memory sticks) are no longer required, that the electronic records and any backups are rendered unreadable. Contact the IT Service Desk for further information.
- Develop and document home-specific procedures regarding the destruction of records. Procedures should include the following:
- Specific method of destruction used;
- Methods of routine destruction of daily accumulation of paper waste containing health data; and
- Periodic destruction of outdated data.

### On-Site Health Record Destruction

- Ensure the home and support office has a confidential shredding bin for the purposes of shredding confidential information including health records.
- Ensure staff are aware of their responsibility to put all confidential information being destroyed, including health records, into a confidential shredding bin rather than the garbage or regular recycling.
- Arrange for the shredding bin to be picked up when full.

### Off-Site Health Record Destruction

- Review the Culling Tracking Record annually to determine which health records require destruction as per the Health Records Retention Table tool.
- Verify that there are no legal holds applicable to the subject record(s).
- Send instructions to the home’s record storage provider to destroy the health records using the method for destruction that is consistent with the type of record being destroyed and complete any necessary documentation.
- Request a certificate of destruction from the records storage provider and retain the certificate on file.
