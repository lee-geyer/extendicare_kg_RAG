Effective auditing will help ensure resident well-being and comfort, while also promoting infection prevention and control standards within the home.Environmental marking measures the thoroughness of cleaning by using a tracing agent to mark items and environmental surfaces prior to cleaning. Following cleaning, an observer can assess the marked surfaces using a detecting agent that allows visualization of the tracing agent to determine whether they were cleaned.### Environmental Marking Auditing SystemsThere are three environmental marking auditing systems available to Extendicare homes:- **Watch ASSURE SYSTEM video** by clicking the YouTube icon.\n- The Cleaning Audit/Tracking Form is available in tools and can be used with both ASSURE (Foam) System and with GLO GERM (Fluorescence).- **Watch DIVERSEY VERICLEAN video** by clicking the YouTube icon.- **Watch GLO GERM SURFACE DETECTION GEL video** by clicking the YouTube icon.----**PAGE 17**```markdown",
