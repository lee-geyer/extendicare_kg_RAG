# How to Wear a Face Mask the Safe and Smart Way!

## The Right Way
- Make sure your mask completely covers your nose and mouth and is secured snugly under your chin.
- Wash your hands before you put on, and after you take off, your mask.
- Touch only the ties or ear loops when putting on or taking off your mask.
- If your mask has a metal wire running along the top edge, mold it over the bridge of your nose to help contain droplets.
- Dispose of the mask when it becomes damaged, soiled, or contaminated with body fluids (droplets/secretions).
- Store masks in a clean environment.

## The Wrong Way
- Don’t touch the outside of your mask while you are wearing it.
- Don’t lower your mask so you can talk.
- Don’t wear a mask that’s too loose or slides down your face.
- Don’t rest your mask around your neck or under your chin.
- Don’t hang your mask off your ear.
- Don’t double-mask (wear one mask on top of another).
