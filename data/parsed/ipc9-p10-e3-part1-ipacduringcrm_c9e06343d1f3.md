# Importance of IPAC during CRM

## Background

- Construction, renovation, and maintenance activities (CRM) are commonly referred to as construction activities.
- CRM activities have been directly linked to the spread of serious infections in healthcare facilities.
- This led to the conclusion that early planning in construction and renovation projects must integrate infection prevention and control (IPAC).
- Prompted the development of Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Z317.13.

# Risks Associated with CRM

## Background

- The disturbance of the home’s structures and the generation of dust, no matter how minimal, may lead to a deadly infection or even outbreaks.
- Dust can carry pathogens, such as Legionella and fungal spores, which can lead to the spread of infectious particles in the air.
- The infectious particles can then be directly inhaled by a resident or contaminate the home’s systems, such as the HVAC and water systems.
- The mortality rates associated with construction-linked infections are high, hence why precautionary measures must be taken during all construction activities in the home.

# Legionella

- **Bacteria** that lives in water and soil
- Causes **Legionnaires’ disease**, a dangerous type of pneumonia
- Mortality rate can be as high as **25-40%**
- Outbreak in **LTC Home in Toronto** where 20+ residents lost their lives 1

# Aspergillus

- A common mold (a type of fungus) that lives indoors and outdoors
- Survives in soil and dust, and can be airborne when disrupted
- Can lead to outbreaks of a fatal lung infection called invasive aspergillosis
- Mortality rate can exceed 40%¹

¹ CDC - Aspergillosis Statistics

# Benefits

## Background

Implementing IPAC measures during the life of the project is of utter importance:

1. Preventing possible infections and/or outbreaks which can lead to a significant loss of life
2. Preventing environmental contamination of the home, ensuring a safe environment for residents, visitors, and staff
3. Avoiding investigations by outside stakeholders
4. In the long run, the home saves more money by preventing unnecessary infections/outbreaks, investigations, and environmental contamination

- **Effective Date:** [Insert Effective Date]
- **Review Date:** [Insert Review Date]

## Introduction
This document outlines the steps and considerations for evaluating Infection Prevention and Control (IPAC) measures during the planning phase of a project.

## Evaluation Steps
1. **Identify IPAC Measures**
- Review existing IPAC protocols.
- Consult with IPAC specialists.

2. **Assess Current Practices**
- Conduct surveys and interviews with staff.
- Analyze incident reports related to infection control.

3. **Develop Evaluation Criteria**
- Define measurable outcomes.
- Establish benchmarks for success.

## Tables
| Evaluation Criteria | Description                     | Measurement Method |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------|
| Compliance Rate     | Percentage of adherence to IPAC | Surveys              |
| Incident Rate       | Number of infection incidents   | Incident reports     |

## Conclusion
Evaluating IPAC measures is crucial for ensuring effective infection control during the planning phase. Regular assessments and updates to protocols are recommended.

# The Infection Control Risk Assessment (ICRA)

## How to Evaluate IPAC Measures

- A systematic tool that is used to assess the risk and the level of Preventive Measures (or IPAC Measures) needed
- Found in the policy tools
- To be completed by the IDT
- ICRA considers two factors when assessing risk:
- The population at risk
- The level of construction activities
- Based on these factors, the ICRA helps determine the level of Preventive Measures
```

```markdown
# Population Risk Group

## How to Evaluate IPAC Measures

- An evaluation of the population that is likely to be affected by the construction work.
- It takes into consideration how close the construction work is to resident care and vulnerable areas.
- Split into 4 categories:
- **Group 1** – Lowest Risk (e.g., Office area, loading dock)
- **Group 2** – Medium Risk (e.g., Reception, common areas)
- **Group 3** – Medium to High Risk (e.g., Resident care areas, medication room)
- **Group 4** – Not applicable to LTC in most cases (e.g., ICU and transplant units)
```

```markdown
# Construction/Renovation Activity Type

## How to Evaluate IPAC Measures

- Evaluated based on the extent of the work that will be done, the length of the project, and the amount of dust that will be generated
- Split into 4 Categories:
- **Type A** – Minor work (e.g., removing a ceiling tile)
- **Type B** – Small scale work, little dust (e.g., painting, minor plumbing)
- **Type C** – Big scale work, more dust (e.g., cutting, sanding, cabling)
- **Type D** – Highest category, significant dust (e.g., demolition, excavation, major cabling)
```

This document serves as a guideline for conducting CRM activities effectively.

# During CRM Activities

- Continue to follow all the preventive measures implemented.
- IPAC Lead/designate audits implemented measures daily.
- Immediately address any deficiencies with corrective actions (do not wait or else you will be putting staff and residents at risk).
- Ensure that audit results are documented.
- Daily enhanced cleaning and disinfection of areas adjacent to the construction zone (treat it as if high touch areas).
- Depending on the size of the project and risk, implement enhanced surveillance for atypical symptoms (e.g., atypical pneumonia, skin infections).

**Note:** Any reports of fungal infections or unexplained pneumonia must be immediately flagged and investigated further.

# Final Construction Clean

## Completion and Occupancy

1. Upon completion of all CRM activities, the constructor must ensure that all the systems that were affected are functioning well. This could mean:
- Flushing of potable water (for at least 10 minutes) in the affected area and adjacent areas before use
- Inspecting the HVAC system to ensure that it is working properly

2. Must also perform a final construction clean before handing the site over to the home (detergent + HEPA vacuuming)
- Final construction clean means no visible debris or dust on any of the surfaces or in any areas (e.g., crevices, cabinets, etc.).

3. Any barriers that were set up must also be cleaned with detergent and HEPA vacuumed before removal.

4. The home does a final inspection and documents the results of the final clean
- Found in the policy tools.
```

```markdown
# Terminal Clean & Occupancy

## Completion and Occupancy

- After completion of the final construction clean and the inspection is satisfactory, and the barriers are removed, the home’s housekeeping department does a terminal clean of the construction area.
- A terminal clean shall follow the policies in Housekeeping and Laundry (which means cleaning and disinfection).
- A terminal clean is similar to a discharge clean (i.e., thorough cleaning and disinfection after a resident is discharged).
- After the terminal clean has been completed, the area is considered ready to be safely occupied.

# Special Considerations

26
```

```markdown
# Mould & Asbestos

## Special Considerations

- Remediation depends on the scale and size of growth/contamination.
- Remediation must be done by contracted professionals. Contaminated areas must not be disrupted by any of the home’s staff (there is an Occupational Health & Safety legal obligation).
- For mould, it is common to have a sample taken (combination of surface and air samples) before starting the work, and another sample after the work is completed to ensure the affected area is clear.
- Mould remediation involves guidelines (EACC & CCA) which also take into account IPAC, and Occupational Health & Safety.
- The external contractors should still follow IPAC protocols when in the home (e.g., pre-determined traffic routes, no cross contamination, proper disinfection, etc.).
