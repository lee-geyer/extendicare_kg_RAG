Surveillance screening for ESBL includes:- A stool specimen or rectal swab (stained with feces). - Urine specimen, if the resident is catheterized and/or ESBL has been identified in a urine culture.Specimens will be labelled as per protocols from the receiving laboratory. Laboratory results will be recorded in the health care record and HealthConnex (if applicable).#### Management and Treatment- Place a newly admitted resident with known risk factors and symptoms or a confirmed history of ESBL on Contact Precautions pending test results based on health authority direction.",
