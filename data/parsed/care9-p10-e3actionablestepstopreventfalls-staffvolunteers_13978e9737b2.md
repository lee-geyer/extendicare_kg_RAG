## Actionable Steps to Prevent Falls – Staff & Volunteers

### 1. Look at residents’ living space & personal safety
- **Keep:**
- a clear well-lit path 2 to 3 feet wide around the bed, from the bed to the hall, from the bed to the bathroom, and from the bed to the lounge chair.
- the bed wheels locked at all times. Report beds with broken wheel locks.
- the overbed table across the bed when it is not in use.
- call bell, water pitcher, cup, Kleenex, remote, grabber, trash can and other personal items within arm’s length of the resident.

- **Report:**
- broken beds (including beds with broken wheel locks).
- loose handrails and toilet seats promptly.
- torn flooring and loose carpet edges.
- burnt out light bulbs.

- Remove clutter & light weighted furniture.
- Wipe up wet spots when you see them.
- Use footwear which has tread on the bottom, a firm shape, and a low, even heel. Use gripper socks when the resident cannot wear safe shoes. Provide proper footcare.
- Ask residents about the 4 P’s (positioning, possessions, pain, prompted toileting), before leaving resident ASK:
- Do you have any pain or discomfort?
- Do you need anything before I leave?
- Are you comfortable?
- Do you need to use the washroom?

### 2. Look at possible side-effects of medication
- Watch residents for potential medication side effects such as confusion, drowsiness, dizziness, changes in gait, loss of balance, and changes in mental status, provide safe seated location for resident and call nurse for support.

### 3. Look at resident transfer and mobility needs
- Ensure mobility devices, including wheelchairs, walkers, and canes, are available/used for residents who need it.
- Know which residents need assistance during transfer and walking. Give help when needed.
- Follow safe resident handling procedures (e.g., right devices/equipment, correct positioning, and transfer techniques). Ensure safe transfer logo is up to date.
- Increase assistance during the first 1 to 3 weeks after move-in, and after a health decline or acute illness.
- For most residents, keep bed in the lowest position at all times. Use a raised toilet seat if ordered.
- Dress the resident in easy-to-manage clothing such as those with elastic bands and Velcro fasteners.
- Provide toileting, food, drink, and activity based on the resident’s individual schedule.
- Check the resident often. Ask volunteers and family to help.

## 4. Look and Check Resident Equipment

- ◻ Ensure the resident has the right mobility aids and it fits correctly.
- ◻ Check the wheelchair brakes often. Report on ones that do not hold the chair firmly in place.
- ◻ Check bed/chair alarm batteries before each use and ensure all fall prevention equipment/bed is plugged in.
- ◻ Check that falls mats are set up according to individualized plan of care.
- ◻ Report all broken or lost parts of wheelchairs, walkers, and canes.
- ◻ Use all of the seating items which are ordered for the resident.
- ◻ Report on any resident who leans over, slides down, or leans to one side while sitting in a wheelchair (figure below).
- ◻ Do not share wheelchairs among residents.
- ◻ Make sure all equipment is labeled with the residents’ name.

* This tool is used as a resource for potential actionable steps to prevent resident falls; however, with all resources, always follow the resident's individualized plan of care for resident-specific information.
