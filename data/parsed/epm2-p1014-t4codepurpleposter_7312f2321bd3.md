# CODE PURPLE
## Emergency Response - Hostage Situation

### What does it mean?
Code Purple is the designated phrase used to alert staff to an incident where any person is being held against their will by another individual.

### What do I do?

#### If you are being held against your will:
- Remain calm. If spoken to, respond in a calm voice.
- Do not be aggressive or use threatening language or body language.
- Do not engage in conversation.
- Never say “no”.
- Review the Code Purple Taken Hostage Tip Sheet in the Code Purple policy.

#### If you encounter a Code Purple situation:
- Remove other individuals from the vicinity for their own safety. If moving is not advisable, shelter in place behind secured doors.
- Prevent traffic by closing doors to the affected area.
- Do NOT announce a Code Purple.
- Call 9-1-1. Be prepared to provide as much information as possible (i.e., location of the incident, number of hostage takers and hostages, physical description and names of hostage takers/hostages (if known), weapons involved, your name, location, and telephone number).
- In unaffected areas, close and secure doors if possible. Ask visitors and residents to remain where they are until the “All Clear” is announced.

### Review it before you need it:
- Refer to your Home’s Emergency Planning and Management Manual, Code Purple.
- Review the Code Purple plan, tip sheet, and checklists that describe your area’s role if a hostage situation occurs.
