## POLICY

### Restraint and PASD Use

### PROCEDURE

The goal of this procedure is to ensure physical restraints and Personal Assistance Service Devices (PASDs) when determined necessary are used safely and in accordance with best practice, legislative and provincial health authority regulations, to support residents’ rights, dignity, and overall well-being.

### Definitions:

- **Physical Restraint**
Any manual method, or physical or mechanical device, material, or equipment that is attached or adjacent to the resident’s body, that the resident cannot easily remove, and restricts freedom of movement or normal access to their body.

- **Personal Assistance Service Device (PASD)**
Devices used to assist a resident and promote independence with a routine activity of daily living (ADL).

### Assessment Process

- The interRAI assessment will be conducted by the interdisciplinary team (IDT) for all residents according to associated timelines to determine the residents’ current physical, cognitive, and psychological status and preferences for care.

- Analysis of assessment outcomes will be completed to determine if the resident’s status may necessitate the need for restraint, and/or PASD to mitigate identified risk the resident may pose to self or others, or to promote independence in ADLs.

- Devices that may be considered for implementation as a physical restraint or a PASD include but may not be limited to the following:
- Seatbelt (front fastening)
- Tabletop tray on wheelchair
- Chair that prevents rising (e.g., tilt wheelchair)
- Bed rails

### Device Consideration

- When a restraint or PASD is being considered, the nurse will first complete a Restraint & PASD Assessment & Evaluation which includes the type of device, the intended purpose, and the effect the device will have on the resident to accurately determine classification and associated restraint or PASD protocols to be followed.

----

### Assessment & Evaluation
- The Restraint & PASD Assessment & Evaluation will include trial interventions to be integrated into the resident's individualized plan of care, or, if alternatives have already been trialed, the rationale for why the IDT has determined them ineffective will be clearly documented.
- If upon move-in a restraint or PASD is being utilized, the same assessment processes are required to determine the need and safety for continued use and to determine whether alternative measures could be implemented.

### Bed Rails
- Prior to implementation of any type of bedrail (full, ¼, ½, ¾, or assist), the following will be completed by the IDT to inform the most appropriate recommendation:
- A 72hr. Sleep Observation for Bed Rail Use to monitor resident sleep patterns to determine whether bed rails can safely be utilized.
- The nurse will review and document outcomes from the 72hr. Sleep Observation for Bed Rail Use on the Restraint/PASD Assessment and Evaluation, where additional elements will be assessed, including the resident’s physical size, mobility status, history of falls from bed, and any cognitive and/or communication deficits.
- Extendicare’s protocols related to bed zones of entrapment must be followed.

### Monitoring and Documentation
- Informed consent will be received, documented, and signed on the Restraint & PASD Consent Form by the resident/SDM/POA, nurse and/or prescriber, and witness for the implementation, change, or discontinuation of any restraint or PASD.
- A resident and/or SDM/POA may withdraw their consent for the restraint at any time, where such requests, along with any actions taken, will be documented in the resident health record.
- Approval is required for the use of any restraint or PASD, where an order will be obtained, indicating the type of device, reason for use, and expected duration.
- The use of a restraint and/or PASD will be documented in the individualized plan of care, including the intent, effect, and indications for how and when the device will be used specific to the individual resident, including requirements for daily monitoring.
- If a PASD that limits or inhibits freedom of movement remains in use after completion of the ADL for which it was intended, restraint protocols will be required.
- Hourly monitoring will be completed for residents with physical restraints. Additionally, the device will be released, the resident repositioned, care provided as required, and the device reapplied at minimum every 2hrs. The exception is bed rail use if the resident can reposition themselves.

### Evaluation and Documentation
- The effectiveness of the physical restraint, including resident condition and response to restraint use, will be evaluated and documented on the Restraint Utilization and Response Tool by the nurse every 8 hours while the restraint is in use.
- Reassessment to determine whether a restraint or PASD is still required will be conducted:
- Quarterly
- With a significant change in condition
- With any change to the use or need for the physical restraint or PASD, which includes all bed rail assessments where applicable if in use.
- The DOC/ADOC will review the restraint and PASD consent form with the resident/SDM/POA during reassessment to verify consent for continued use and ensure the consent form is resigned during the annual care conference.
- A Restraint & PASD Monthly Analysis of restraint and PASD utilization in the home will be completed by the DOC/ADOC designate.
- Prior to the discontinuation of any restrictive device, there must be a documented restrictive device trial free period, where alternative measures have been determined effective, to ensure the residents’ safety and care needs have been maintained.
