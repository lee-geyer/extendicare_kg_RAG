# Guidelines for Clear Liquid (Fluid) Diet

## PURPOSE
To provide a temporary diet that contains minimal fibre with some energy and electrolytes to prevent dehydration while allowing the digestive system to rest. Alternatively, this diet may be utilized as a base to support comfort or enteral feeding.

## INDICATIONS
- Acute illness
- Acute nausea
- Acute diarrhea
- Preparation for some investigative tests
- When minimal residue is desired
- Pre-operative; post-operative gastrointestinal
- To support individual preference, palliation or comfort

**Note:** Since this is NOT nutritionally adequate, a resident should not remain on this diet for more than 48 hours related to acute illness. If the resident is unable to advance to solids after 48 hours, the Nurse shall consult the Registered Dietitian or Physician/Nurse Practitioner. For residents requiring this diet for a longer time period, supplementation may be appropriate based on residents’ wishes and goals of care and will be assessed by the Registered Dietitian.

## DESCRIPTION
A clear liquid diet consists of clear liquids or foods that are liquid at body temperature and leave a minimum amount of residue in the gastrointestinal tract. Broth and juice provide sodium and potassium replacement. This diet may be used as a base to support comfort feeding through personal menus (see interventions) or enteral feeding.

### Food Groups

| **Foods Allowed**                                           | **Foods Not Allowed**                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|

## INDICATIONS
- To provide food and liquids to residents who are unable to chew, swallow or digest solid foods.
- To support individual preference, palliation, or comfort.

**Note:** Since this is NOT nutritionally adequate, a resident should not remain on this diet for more than 48 hours. If the resident is unable to advance to solids after 48 hours, Nursing shall consult the Registered Dietitian or Physician/Nurse Practitioner. For residents requiring this diet for a longer time period, supplementation may be appropriate based on resident’s wishes and goals of care and will be assessed by the Registered Dietitian.

## DESCRIPTION
A full liquid diet consists of liquids or foods that are liquid or pudding thick at body temperature. A small amount of fibre is provided. This diet can be used as a base for residents requiring a personal menu (see interventions) or enteral feeding.

To promote healing of the small intestine, allow normal nutrient digestion and absorption, and decrease symptoms caused by sensitivity to gluten and gluten-containing products.

## INDICATIONS
- Celiac disease
- Gluten intolerance/sensitivity

## INTERVENTIONS
- The Gluten-Restricted diet can be combined with other intervention selections to further individualize nutrition care.
- For the most up-to-date information, including references for both Residents/Families and Health Care professionals, reference Celiac Canada.

## DIET ORDER
- Gluten-Restricted Diet, Food Texture, Liquid Consistency, and any interventions as needed.
For more information, refer to: Celiac Canada

# Guidelines for Vegetarian Diet

## PURPOSE
To provide a menu alternative to residents who prefer vegetarian menu choices. This preference may be related to dietary needs, religion, cultural background, or personal philosophy.

## INDICATIONS
- Religious beliefs
- Cultural requirements
- Personal philosophy

## INTERVENTIONS
- The vegetarian menu is based on lacto-ovo principles: excludes meat, poultry, fish, and seafood. The menu contains dairy products and eggs.
- The vegetarian menu can be customized further to meet the resident’s individual needs:
- **Vegan**: excludes meat, poultry, fish, seafood, eggs, milk, milk products, and honey.
- **Ovo-vegetarian**: excludes meat, poultry, fish, seafood, milk, and milk products.
- **Lacto-vegetarian**: excludes meat, poultry, fish, seafood, and eggs.
- Menu customization may be completed by modifying a copy of the vegetarian diet with appropriate texture. The Culinary Manager is responsible for ensuring recipes are available and required items are included on production sheets.
- The vegetarian diet can be combined with other intervention selections to further individualize nutrition care.

## DIET ORDER
- Vegetarian Diet, Food Texture, Liquid Consistency, and any interventions as needed.

# Guidelines for Low Potassium Diet

## Purpose
To provide a nutritionally adequate diet with modifications to limit the amount of potassium provided (2-3 g/day).

## Indications
- Renal failure
- Elevated potassium

## Interventions

### Fruits/Vegetables
- Avoid fruits/vegetables and their juices over 200 mg/serving (refer to PEN food list).
- Potatoes:
- Use double boiled if fresh (then served as is, or roasted etc.) OR
- Use the approved instant mashed potatoes

### Dairy
- Limit milk to 125 ml at breakfast
- Limit yogurt to 125 ml serving per day

### Grains/Cereals
- Avoid: bran
- Allow:
- white and brown rice
- rice cereal
- cornmeal hot cereal
- cream of wheat
- cold cereal (not bran)
- white bread products
- quinoa and barley

### Proteins
- Nut Butters (e.g., peanut butter): Do not use. Instead, substitute with egg or cheese.
- Legumes (e.g., lentils, kidney beans, chickpeas, navy, black, pinto beans etc.):
- Limit on a “regular menu”, limit legumes to a cooked 125 ml serving 3 or 4 times/week; consider the utilization of alternate proteins such as tofu, tempeh, seitan, or eggs.
- On a culturally specific menu (e.g., Indian/vegetarian), these restrictions are likely not possible to meet protein needs and be culturally acceptable – focusing on other food restrictions will be necessary (e.g., the fruits, vegetables etc.). The home RD will need to make individual menu modifications for each resident.
- Consider soaking dried legumes overnight or drain and soak canned legumes prior to cooking. This would be done for the entire recipe/diets, not just those on the potassium restriction. “Leaching” decreases potassium by about 50%.
- Consider using canned beans as they tend to have less potassium than dried.
- Fish (e.g., cod, halibut, salmon, bass etc.): On an individual basis (not on master menu), limit fish fillets to 3 times per week and substitute battered/breaded fish/seafood.

# Guidelines for Low Potassium Diet

## Miscellaneous
- Avoid sauces that contain high potassium items e.g., tomato, commercially prepared sauces/condiments.
- Avoid chocolate in beverages and desserts. Instead, substitute with another flavour.

## Combination Foods (to be used as a guideline)
- Protein/starch: maximum 400mg potassium.
- Protein/starch/vegetable: maximum 600mg potassium.

## DIET ORDER
Low Potassium Diet, Food Texture, Liquid Consistency, and any interventions as needed.

# Guidelines for Thickened Liquid (Fluid) Consistencies

## PURPOSE
To provide liquid (fluid) consistencies that are appropriate for residents with difficulty swallowing liquids (fluids) or beverages.

## INDICATIONS
- Dysphagia, including inability to safely swallow regular liquid (fluid) consistency.
- Thickened liquids (fluids) are often used in the management of dysphagia to improve bolus control and, therefore, reduce the risk of aspiration.

## DESCRIPTION
The Registered Dietitian (RD), Speech Language Pathologist (SLP) or Occupational Therapist (OT) will recommend providing thickened liquids (fluids) after an assessment has taken place. All liquids (fluids), including supplements and soup, are thickened to correct consistency before administering or serving, as indicated in the resident’s plan of care.

The standard meal pattern provides a minimum of 1500 ml liquid (fluid) per day with an additional 750 ml from snacks. Servings of high liquid (fluid) foods can be substituted for thickened liquids (fluids) if necessary. High liquid (fluid) foods have a liquid (fluid) content greater than 80% and include items such as:
- Pureed fruit
- Thickened soup
- Pudding
- Yogurt

### Standard liquid (fluid) consistencies at Extendicare consist of:
| Consistency Level | Description          |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Thin Level 0 (TNO)/Regular | Regular thin liquids |
| Mildly Thick Level 2 (MT2)/Nectar Like | Nectar-like consistency |
| Moderately Thick Level 3 (MO3)/Honey Like | Honey-like consistency |
| Extremely Thick Level 4 (EX4)/Pudding Like | Pudding-like consistency |

Some foods become liquid (fluid) in the mouth such as Ice Cream/Sherbet/Frozen Yogurt, Popsicles, and Gelatin. These items are generally not recommended for individuals requiring thickened liquids (fluids) and, therefore, should only be provided after assessment and approval by the RD/SLP/OT (assessor). Unless adjusted on an individual basis, these items will be substituted in the food service software.

Liquids (fluids) with chunks such as fruit, nuts, seeds, or ice cubes are not provided unless approved by the assessor.

Oral Care, including hygiene, is of high importance when dysphagia is present to mitigate the risk of choking and/or aspiration pneumonia. Oral hygiene after meals/snacks is recommended to eliminate food debris and reduce oral bacteria.

Thin (regular) water (without food) may be offered after assessment and discussion with the resident and interdisciplinary care team and relies heavily on oral hygiene prior to the consumption of the water.

| All as appropriate to the primary Diet type and Food Texture | Any identified under “foods not allowed”                |

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR USE OF THICKENED LIQUIDS (FLUIDS)

- Thickened beverages will be purchased pre-thickened or if prepared in-house, will be prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions to reach the required consistency.
- Residents who require thickened liquids (fluids) are at greater risk for dehydration. Therefore, adequate liquids (fluids) must be offered according to the resident’s plan of care.
- Temperatures can affect the consistency of thickened beverages by thinning or thickening; as such, always verify that the actual thickness is appropriate before providing such thickened beverages to the resident.

# Guidelines for Thickened Liquid (Fluid) Consistencies

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR USE OF THICKENED LIQUIDS (FLUIDS)

Thickened liquids (fluids) are usually best consumed from a cup, nosey cup, mug, or teaspoon to reduce the risk of aspiration. The use of straws and sippy cups may send the beverage further back into the mouth or throat before the swallow has initiated. Use of a straw or sippy cup with thickened liquids (fluids) should only be used if recommended by the assessor.

## MEDICATIONS

Medications may need to be modified to promote safe swallowing and should be determined on an individual basis and discussed with the Physician/Nurse Practitioner/Pharmacist as required. Whole pills/capsules may be tolerated with a smooth food OR solid medications may need to be crushed, or capsules opened and given with a smooth food such as pudding. It is not recommended that whole pills be provided with thickened liquids (fluids) as this creates “two consistencies” and may result in aspiration and/or choking. Be aware that some liquid (fluid) medications cannot be effectively thickened (they may remain thin OR the medication’s absorption can be affected).

### Two known medications of concern are:
1. **Polyethylene Glycol laxative (PEG)** should not be given to residents receiving thickened liquids (fluids) made with “starch thickeners” as they break down to thin liquids (fluids). Thickeners made with xanthan gum are safe to use with PEG.
2. **Metamucil** is not recommended for people with swallowing difficulty; as well, taking Metamucil without adequate liquid (fluid) may cause it to swell and block the throat or esophagus, causing choking.

## DIET ORDER
- Diet Type
- Food Texture
- Liquid Consistency

Additional instructions may be required such as interventions, including but not limited to:
- High Calorie High Protein
- Lactose Restricting interventions.

# Guidelines for Lactose-Restricting Interventions

## PURPOSE
To prevent or reduce gastrointestinal symptoms of bloating, flatulence, cramping, nausea, and diarrhea associated with consumption of the disaccharide lactose.

## INDICATIONS
- Residents with lactose intolerance or lactase deficiency.
- Individual tolerance will determine the degree to which lactose needs to be removed from the diet.
- Most persons with lactase non-persistence can consume dairy products and small quantities of fluid milk without the development of symptoms.
- These interventions do NOT provide a dairy or milk free menu and are not intended for use with allergies as some dairy remains on the menu based on the interventions selected and trace amounts of dairy in some recipes and products.

## INTERVENTIONS
- These interventions can be combined with other interventions to further individualize nutritional care.
- The table below indicates commonly utilized interventions. Other interventions may be utilized as appropriate to the resident.
- Select the appropriate diet and texture, select the appropriate interventions.

### Interventions (Choose ONLY interventions appropriate for the resident)
| Intervention                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Substitute regular cow’s milk with lactose-free milk or dairy substitute at meals and snacks    |
| Substitute unripened cheeses with aged cheese such as Cheddar, Brick, Swiss, or Parmesan       |
| Substitute cottage cheese and yogurt with lactose-free versions (as available) or alternate     |
| Substitute cream soups with broth-based soups                                                  |

# Guidelines for Managing Liquid (Fluid) Restrictions

## PURPOSE
To aid in the planning and provision of fluids (liquids) for Residents who require a fluid restriction.

## ASSESSMENT
1. In consultation with the physician, determine appropriate amount of total fluid to be recommended in a 24-hour period.
2. Determine if a specified amount is required for med pass (or if served fluids will be utilized or if pudding/applesauce will be utilized).

## PLAN
3. With the Resident/SDM, determine an appropriate plan for amounts and types of fluids at meals and snacks.
4. Determine appropriate alternatives (examples: drained/pureed fruit, pudding, ice cream, ice chips) for Resident if thirst is not relieved with the recommended plan or when fluids are not provided at the scheduled snack time(s).

## IMPLEMENT
5. Develop a guideline for reference by the Resident/SDM (may be in ml or cups as per Resident preference).

Example: 1400 ml restriction, do not allow ice chips due to inability to safely consume.

## 6. Electronic or Written Prescribed Orders:
a. Specific liquid restriction is to be added to special instructions in the diet order within the resident’s electronic health record
b. Specific liquid restriction is to be added to the appropriate Focus in the resident’s care plan

## 7. Food Service Software System:
a. Select Fluid Type “FLUID RESTRICTION”
i. **NOTE:** If the Resident receives thickened liquids, keep this as the fluid/liquid instead of choosing Fluid Restriction.
b. ADD: Service Notes: xxx ml Fluid Restriction
c. In Personal Menus, select “Personal Items”
i. Select specific beverages and adjust amounts using Serving Size Adjustment for each meal and snack.
OR
ii. ADD New item: In Food Type, select “non-food” and then GO. Look for “Fluid Restriction Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner/AM/PM/HS/None”. Select the appropriate meal or snack. Select the desired menu categories. Adjust the amount to be allotted for each meal or snack.

# What is a Bite-Sized Piece?

## PURPOSE
To provide a food texture that requires no or minimal modification in texture.

## INDICATIONS
- To provide food to residents who have no difficulty in chewing, swallowing, or digesting all food textures.
- To provide a base texture for residents who require manipulation to the regular texture related to managing eating risk.
- To support individual preference and care goals.

## DESCRIPTION
A regular food texture consists of all foods that are solid at body temperature. Manipulation to the regular texture may be required to manage eating risk (e.g., resident eats too quickly and/or declines recommended texture modification) or to accommodate reduced bite strength/ability.

## INTERVENTIONS
Recommendations for the modification of regular texture:
- The definition of “bite-sized piece” is approximately 1 x 1.5 cm for adults.
- Additional instructions will be specific: “Cut <specify food/group> into bite-sized pieces”
- Do not state “cut food into bite-sized pieces” which is vague.
- If all food is to be cut, state “Cut ALL food into bite-sized pieces.”
- A standardized process for who will cut up the food will be established and documented in the appropriate location, so all staff are aware.
- Food must be cut by culinary staff either at point of plating or in the kitchen.

## DIET ORDER
- Diet Type (Gluten Restricted, Lactose Restricted, Vegetarian), Regular Texture, Fluid Consistency. Cut <specify food/group> into bite-sized pieces (this is to be added to special instructions in the diet order within the resident’s electronic health record)
- Example Diet Order with “cut up” instructions:
- Regular Diet, Regular Texture, Thin Level 0/Regular Fluids, Cut meat and vegetables into bite-sized pieces
- Add any other interventions including but not limited to, High Calorie High Protein and Potassium increasing interventions.

Food Service Software: Regular Diet (or Gluten-Restricted, Low Potassium, or Vegetarian), Food Texture, Liquid Consistency. The “cut up” instruction is also included in the resident’s Nutrition Profile using the exact same wording as in the diet order.

# What is a Bite Sized Piece?
Approximately 1 x 1.5 cm

## Why so small?
- Compromised chewing ability.
- Decreased muscle strength that can affect biting, chewing, or swallowing (jaw, tongue, mouth, throat).
- A resident may take the next bite of food before completely chewing and swallowing the current mouthful.
- A resident may put too much food in their mouth at one time.

# Guidelines for No Mixed Consistencies

## PURPOSE
To eliminate foods with both solid and liquid consistencies in a single food/bolus which may be more difficult to manage and may increase the risk of aspiration or choking.

## INDICATIONS
- Dysphagia which includes inability to handle two different types of consistencies.

## DESCRIPTION
Mixed Consistencies consist of solids floating in a thin liquid OR liquid released when chewed. A person must have adequate ability to handle two different types of consistencies when swallowing. The liquid can move to the back of the throat into the pharynx really quickly while the solids remain in the mouth cavity while chewing, which can result in aspiration. There is also risk that solid particles may travel with the liquids into the pharynx, which can result in choking or airway obstruction.

### Examples include:
- Soup with vegetables
- Canned fruit with juice
- Cold cereal with milk
- Very juicy fresh fruit (watermelon)
- Creamed corn
- Thin stews

## INTERVENTIONS
- Substitute foods that combine a liquid with solid pieces in the same mouthful or release liquid when chewed (Example: offer hot cereal in place of cold cereal)
- Allow foods with thick liquid and solids combined such as a stew
- Provide soup in pureed format only
- Drain canned fruit
- Provide pureed format

## DIET ORDER
- Regular Diet (or Gluten-Restricted, Low Potassium or Vegetarian), Food Texture, Liquid Consistency, No Mixed Consistencies (this is to be added to special instructions in the diet order within the resident’s electronic health record)

### Food Service Software:
Regular Diet (or Gluten-Restricted, Low Potassium or Vegetarian), Food Texture, Liquid Consistency. Add individualized interventions into the resident’s Personal Menu.

# Guidelines for Finger Foods

# Guidelines for Increased Fibre Interventions

## PURPOSE
To increase fibre intake to help promote normal bowel function and assist in the management of constipation without the use or reduced use of laxatives.

## INDICATIONS
- Constipation
- To reduce laxative use
- Irritable Bowel Syndrome

**Note:** Increased fibre in the diet may be contraindicated for persons with autonomic neuropathy, gastroparesis, post-gastrectomy or pseudo-obstructions, intestinal strictures, acute Crohn’s disease, and acute diverticulitis.

## INTERVENTIONS
- These interventions can be combined with other intervention selections to further individualize nutritional care.
- The table below includes commonly utilized interventions. Other interventions may be utilized as appropriate to the resident.
- Fibre content must be increased gradually, based on individual tolerance, to minimize potential adverse side effects such as abdominal distress, bloating, flatulence, cramps, and diarrhea.
- Adequate fluids as per assessed fluid requirements should be consumed by the resident before increased fibre is introduced.
- Select the appropriate diet and texture, select appropriate interventions.

## DIET ORDER
- Regular Diet (or Gluten-Restricted, Low Potassium or Vegetarian), Food Texture, Liquid Consistency, Increased Fibre Interventions (this is to be added to special instructions in the diet order within the resident’s electronic health record).

# Guidelines for Pureed Texture

## PURPOSE
To provide a food texture that requires no biting or chewing.

## INDICATIONS
- To provide an appropriate food texture to residents who have difficulty chewing and/or swallowing.
- To support individual preference and care goals.

## DESCRIPTION
- Pureed foods should be smooth with no lumps, minimal granulation, and one homogenous colour and texture.
- Cohesive enough to hold shape on a teaspoon but will fall off the spoon in one spoonful if the spoon is tilted or turned sidewise.
- On a plate, may spread out slightly but should retain some shape.
- Foods are moist and cohesive with no water separation.
