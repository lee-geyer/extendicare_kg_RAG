## C. Wound Type and Measurement

1. **Choose Wound Type**
- 1) Arterial / Ischemic
- 2) Venous / Stasis
- 3) Mixed
- 4) Pressure
- 5) Diabetic Foot
- 6) Skin tear (ulcerated)
- 7) Surgical Incision (open)

**1b. What is the source of pressure or injury type?**
- a. Prolonged pressure over bony prominence
- b. Kennedy Terminal Ulcer
- c. Medical Device Related Pressure Injury

**1bd. Details on cause of injury:**

**ACTION REQUIRED:**
Ensure the plan of care addresses the source of pressure and includes strategies to remove or relieve pressure to assist with healing and prevent further injury.

**1c. Pressure Injury Stage**
- 0) Deep Tissue Pressure Injury
- 1) Stage 1 - Any area of persistent skin redness — An area of skin that appears continually reddened and does not disappear when pressure is relieved. There is no break in the skin.
- 2) Stage 2 - Partial loss of skin layers — A partial-thickness loss of skin that presents clinically as an abrasion, blister, or shallow crater.
- 3) Stage 3 - Deep craters in the skin — A full thickness of skin is lost, exposing the subcutaneous tissues. Presents as a deep crater with or without undermining of adjacent tissue.
- 4) Stage 4 - Breaks in skin exposing muscle or bone — A full thickness of skin and subcutaneous tissue is lost, exposing muscle or bone.
- 5) Unstageable (Not codeable — For example, because necrotic eschar is predominant.)

2. **Length (cm)**
Measure at the longest axis of the wound surface head to toe.

## PUSH Score

### Score:
1. **Width (cm)**: Measure at the widest axis of wound surface side to side, perpendicular (90 degree angle) to length.
2. **Depth (cm)**: Measure the vertical distance to the deepest point of the wound bed.
3. **Is tunneling present?** (Tunneling is tracts of tissue loss that extend out from the wound bed.)
- 1. Yes
- 0. No
4. **Provide details on location of tunneling** (use the Clock System, where the resident's head is 12 o'clock):
5. **Is undermining present under the wound edge?** (Undermining is loss of deep tissue around the wound edges.)
- 1. Yes
- 0. No
6. **Provide details on location of undermining**, including sinus tracts (use the Clock System, where the resident's head is 12 o'clock), and estimate the percentage (%) of wound involvement (e.g., 30%):

## D. PUSH Score and SURFACE AREA Score/Category

**SURFACE AREA:** Once the C2. LENGTH and C3. WIDTH [above] are entered choose 'SAVE'.
This action will MULTIPLE L x W and produce a score called 'Surface AREA'.
The 'Surface AREA' category will display the ANSWER to QUESTION 1 SIZE [below].
Manually enter the answer to question 1 below.
Questions 1, 2 & 3 are required to produce the PUSH score (size, exudate, and tissue type).

### 1. SIZE
- **Surface Area (L x W)**
- 0. 0 cm²
- 1. <0.3 cm²
- 2. 0.3 - 0.69 cm²
- 3. 0.7 - 1.0 cm²
- 4. 1.01 - 2.0 cm²
- 5. 2.01 - 3.0 cm²
- 6. 3.01 - 4.0 cm²
- 7. 4.01 - 8.0 cm²
- 8. 8.01 - 12.0 cm²
- 9. 12.01 - 24.0 cm²
- 10. > 24 cm²

### 2. EXUDATE
Estimate the amount of exudate (drainage) present after removal of the dressing and before applying any topical agent to the ulcer. Estimate the exudate (drainage) as none, light, moderate, or heavy.
- **Exudate Amount**
- 0. None
- 1. Light (< 25% drainage on dressing)
- 2. Moderate (25 - 75%)

- b. Slow to Heal: wound healing is slow or stalled but stable, little/no deterioration
- c. Monitor/Manage: Wound healing not achievable due to untreatable underlying condition
