## POLICY

### Personal Clothing and Linen Processes

## PROCEDURE

The Manager/Designate will:

- Arrange to have an automatic dispensing station set up in the Laundry Department for chemicals.
- Train laundry staff to check and monitor the operation of the automatic dispensing system and chemical levels.
- Stock day-to-day dispensed laundry chemicals and chemicals not automatically dispensed.
- Instruct laundry staff to report to you if they notice a wash load that retains a bad odour, including a strong chemical odour, or that shows excessive staining.
- Review Changing Laundry Chemical Containers (Education section) with staff.

### DOMESTIC WASHERS – HOME OR RESIDENT USE

- If the home decides to purchase domestic washers for home areas or utility rooms, ask the laundry chemical supplier whether they can install an automatic dispensing system for laundry chemicals.
- If an automatic dispensing system is installed, ensure equipment operating instructions are posted at the washer(s).

### TIPS

- Automatic dispensing of chemicals ensures that laundry detergents and additives are dispensed in the right concentrations. This ensures that best results are obtained for the lowest cost.
- For costing or usage concerns, it is recommended to ask the chemical supplier to provide documentation that shows the amount of each laundry product being dispensed during each wash cycle.
