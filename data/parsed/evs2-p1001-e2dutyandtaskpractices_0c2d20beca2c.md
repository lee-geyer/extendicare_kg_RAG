### Duty and Task Practices:
Housekeeping staff will have monitoring through direct supervision to ensure that procedures below are being adhered to.

- Clean all visible organic soils from the surface and then wipe with disinfectant cleaner. Keep the surface wet with disinfectant according to the manufacturer's rated time for disinfection.
- Items or contact points which are considered high touch or critical surfaces may require a more generous application to increase dwell/contact time for the disinfectant. The following recommended method to apply disinfectant may be used:
1. A predetermined number of microfibre cloths and a disinfectant with a 5 minute contact time is used.
**Note:** For horizontal or heavily soiled surfaces, disinfectant may be applied with flip-top directly to the soil.
- Change the mopping solution every 3 to 4 rooms or when visibly soiled.
- Change the mopping solution, clean microfibre cloths and mop heads after contact with contaminated soils such as urine, feces, blood, or other body fluids.
- Clean the equipment with disinfectant after contact with contaminated soil before continuing cleaning duties.
- Change the cleaning cloths after every resident room/area or when visibly soiled or if surface does not remain damp for required contact/dwell time of disinfectant used.
- Clean each bathroom with a new cleaning microfibre cloth, separate from the cloth used to clean the resident room/area.
- Clean toilets inside with a bowl swab and outside with the designated cleaning cloth.
- Clean outside of toilets from the least soiled areas to the most soiled areas (i.e. outside of tank/handle to outside bottom of toilet and up to seat and then the rim).
- Change dust mops and wet mops a minimum of 3 times per shift and when visibly soiled.
- Deposit used cleaning cloths into the soil collection bag on the housekeeping cart after every room/area cleaning.
- Shake dust mops and dusting tools inside a garbage bag.
- Clean all high-touch surfaces such as handrails, doorknobs, light switches, bedrails, call bells and elevator buttons daily, using a hospital-grade disinfectant cleaner.
- Apply disinfectant cleaner to bathroom fixtures prior to cleaning resident room to allow for a longer contact time. **(Recommendation)**
