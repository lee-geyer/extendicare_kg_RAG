## POLICY

### Infection Prevention

## PROCEDURE

Hair care services (hairdressing/barber) will be provided in a safe manner, following established infection prevention and control guidelines.

- Any hair care provider with open lesions or weeping dermatitis, such as eczema on the hands or other areas which are not adequately covered, shall refrain from direct contact with residents until the condition clears or shall wear single-use, disposable gloves. Single-use, disposable gloves must be discarded between residents.
- Hair care should not be performed on a resident affected or suspected to have an infestation (e.g., head lice), and a nurse will be notified immediately.
- Hand hygiene will be performed based on the 4 moments for hand hygiene.
- Hair care services will follow provincial regulations as they exist and where required public health authority will be notified prior to commencing operation.

### Cleaning and Disinfecting of Instruments, Equipment and Surfaces

- Clean and disinfect reusable instruments/equipment and work-contact surfaces (e.g., chairs, and equipment trays or tables) after each use using an Extendicare-approved disinfectant.
- All towels shall be laundered and thoroughly dried in a mechanical dryer and stored in a clean manner before reuse. Separate towels must be used for each resident. Disposable neck strips or clean towels shall be provided under reusable capes for each resident.
- The neck rest will be cleaned and disinfected between residents.
- Non-critical items that contact intact skin, such as combs, brushes, clipper blades, scissors, rollers, etc., shall be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected with a low-level disinfectant (e.g., Barbicide) after each use. If a non-critical item, such as scissors or clippers, nicks the skin or any instrument becomes visibly contaminated with blood, it must be discarded or sent away for reprocessing before it can be reused.
- All disinfectant solutions must be discarded and changed at the end of each working day and documented or as per manufacturer instructions (Refer to the Disinfectant Log).
