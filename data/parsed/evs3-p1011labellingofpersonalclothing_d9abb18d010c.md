## POLICY
### Personal Clothing and Linen Processes

## PROCEDURE

### Manager or Designate:
- Review the procedures and adapt to your home’s specific needs.
- Develop a labelling procedure for your home that addresses the following:
- How is clothing getting down to department to be labelled?
- Who is responsible for completing the Personal Clothing Form?
- Who prepares the heat seal labels?
- Who is responsible for placing labels on clothing?
- Who is responsible for delivering clothing back to resident?
- Central location for the holding of completed forms?
- Review the Tool – Personal Clothing Form and amend according to your home’s needs. Provide copies of the final form to staff.
- Have a system in place for filing personal clothing forms and make sure every form is signed.
- Ensure there is a sufficient supply of labels available in the home.

### ADDITIONAL CLOTHING:
- Designate an area in the home and provide a container to collect additional clothing brought into the home for labelling.

### Registered Staff or Move-In Team:
- Inform the resident/family that the home provides personal clothing services for residents. Advise them that it is the home’s policy to label each article of clothing brought into the home. Explain how the system works.
- Personal clothing may be laundered by the family if the family requests it. If the family processes the resident’s clothing and does not want clothing labelled, inform the family of the risks involved in having clothing in the home that is not labelled, and document this communication in the resident’s plan of care.
- Inform the resident/family that charges for the home processing the resident’s laundry, if any, is determined by provincial regulation.
