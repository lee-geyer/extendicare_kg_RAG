# Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE)
## Information for Residents and Visitors

Please read this fact sheet and ask staff if you have any questions.

### WHAT IS VRE?
VRE stands for Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci, which is a type of germ that usually lives in most people’s bowels without causing any illness. However, it can cause infections, usually in people who are already sick. When Vancomycin, a modern antibiotic, cannot kill this germ, it is said to be “resistant.”

### HOW CAN VRE SPREAD?
VRE can survive on surfaces like toilet seats, tables, and equipment. Diarrhea, poor hygiene, and inadequate cleaning are ways in which the germ can be spread. Good hand washing and hygiene are the best way to prevent spreading of the germ.

### WHAT ABOUT YOUR FAMILY AND VISITORS?
You may still have visitors. They may be asked to put on gloves and wear a gown over their clothes. This gown should be removed before your visitors leave your room. It is very important that your visitors wash their hands before they leave your room. Residents with VRE do not pose a risk to their families or to other healthy people. VRE is only a problem for people who are already seriously ill and are prone to developing infections.

### WHAT CAN YOU DO?
Wash your hands well and frequently. Your cooperation with the special precautions in place is most appreciated.
