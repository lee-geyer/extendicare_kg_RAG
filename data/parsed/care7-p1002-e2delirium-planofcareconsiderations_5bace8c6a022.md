## Delirium - Plan of Care Considerations

### What is delirium?
Delirium is a serious and complex syndrome characterized by a disturbance in attention, awareness, and cognition often caused by a combination of medical conditions, medications, or environmental factors. Delirium may be a medical emergency and warrants further assessment.

### What are the risk factors for delirium?
- Advanced age
- Cognitive impairment/dementia
- Medical illness (including infections, medication)
- Medication changes
- Hearing or vision impairments
- Functional dependence (i.e., may lead to inadequate nutrition or hydration)
- Depression
- Alcohol misuse
- Abnormal sodium levels in the blood
- Males are at higher risk for delirium compared to females

### What is the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)?
The CAM is a widely used tool for quickly identifying delirium. It assesses four key features:
1. **Acute onset and fluctuating course**: Sudden changes in mental status that vary throughout the day that are not normal for the resident.
2. **Inattention**: Difficulty focusing or maintaining attention that is not normal for the resident.
3. **Disorganized thinking**: Illogical or incoherent thought process that is not normal for the resident.
4. **Altered level of consciousness**: Ranges from hyper alertness to drowsiness or lethargy.

Delirium is suspected if a CAM screen is ‘positive’ if both features 1 & 2 are present, plus either feature 3 or feature 4 are present. Refer to Assessment for Mental Health – Confusion Assessment Method (CAM).

### If delirium is suspected from a positive CAM, what interventions in the plan of care should be considered?
Engage the interdisciplinary team to consider the following:

- **Physiological**:
- Assess for physical causes of delirium (i.e., pain, infections, cardiovascular stability)
- Consider diagnostic investigations (i.e., bloodwork, urine, chest x-ray, etc.)
- Assess for symptoms of delirium (i.e., hallucinations or delusions that the resident is not known to normally exhibit)
- Ensure bladder and bowel are working well
- Assess for medications known to cause delirium
- Monitor nutrition/hydration
