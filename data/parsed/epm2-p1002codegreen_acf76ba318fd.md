## POLICY

### Emergency Response Codes

## PROCEDURE

Code Green is announced when an emergency occurs that requires evacuation. The Incident Manager or the fire department determines if an evacuation is required. The Code Green is then initiated by announcing a Code Green and manually activating the second stage of the fire alarm at the pull station using the fire key. All Staff must follow the procedures for evacuation as per their designated Job Action checklists and follow direction from the Incident Manager.

The Incident Manager will determine and announce the type of evacuation to occur:

- **Horizontal Evacuation**
- Move residents from one area of the floor to another area of the same floor behind fire barrier doors.

- **Vertical Evacuation**
- Move residents from one floor towards the ground floor.
- In a partial evacuation, a horizontal evacuation is preferred to avoid moving residents through stairways. However, depending on the emergency, there may be no choice (e.g., when the fire is between the resident and the closest fire doors and the only exit is through the stairway).

- **Total Evacuation**
- Total evacuation outside the building and occurs only in an extreme emergency.
