## Self-Administration of Medication Procedures

1. During the supervised self-administration of medication phase, the nurse will document medication taken and the amount of assistance required in the Medication Administration Record (MAR) or Electronic Administration Record (eMAR), Treatment Administration Record (TAR) or Electronic Treatment Administration Record (eTAR).

2. Prior to commencing independent self-administration of medication, ensure the resident:
- a. Demonstrates knowledge of all medications;
- b. Has a Physician/NP order for all medications;
- c. Completes a self-administration of medication agreement. See Self-Administration of Medication Agreement, Appendix 2.
- d. Is aware that follow-up (e.g. spot checks) will occur; and
- e. Has a key for locked drawer/cabinet and an understanding of the importance of keeping the drawer locked.

3. A weekly supply of labeled medication will be provided and documented on the MAR/eMAR/TAR/eTAR. The nurse will check expiry dates of medication such as creams/ointments and eye drops.

4. The nurse will document on the MAR/eMAR/TAR/eTAR daily that the Resident is on an independent self-administration of medication program.

5. Store all medications in a locked bedside drawer/cabinet to which the resident and nurse will have the key.

6. Ensure the resident's plan of care reflects independent self-administration.

7. Assess the resident's ability to continue with independent self-administration of medication quarterly or with a significant change in condition.

8. The nurse will monitor medication utilization and investigate discrepancies.

9. Review immediately concerns related to the resident's ability to safely and independently self-administer medication to assess the safety of continuing independent self-administration of medication.

10. Investigate immediately any reported or identified discrepancies. A Medication Incident Report will be completed and the Physician/NP will be notified as soon as possible. Self-administration of the medications will be discontinued pending the findings of the investigation.

11. Evaluate and audit the Self-Administration of Medication policy to ensure compliance and identify opportunities for quality improvement.
