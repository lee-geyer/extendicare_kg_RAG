One person should take the lead for communication. Another person should be available to remove the speaking staff member from any direct contact as needed but should remain silent. Too many people talking can further agitate and confuse the aggressive individual.2. **Apologize**\n- Even if you had no control over the situation, apologize for their experience. Be sincere. This will often diffuse a situation.3. **Empathize - Try to Understand their feelings**\n- It is likely that this situation is about their feelings, even if they are unable to vocalize them. Try to identify their feelings through the words, actions, and expressions they are portraying to better understand what they are going through.4. **Listen and do not be Judgmental**\n- Do not dismiss or judge what the individual may say; listen to their concerns and understand that their thoughts and feelings are real.5.",

Avoid negative and aggressive words such as swear words and words with negative meanings.8. **Don’t get emotional**\n- Remain calm and in control of yourself.9. **Do not give in to challenges and challenging questions**\n- Answering challenging questions is likely to be detrimental to the de-escalation. Responses can agitate the individual further or show them that they can obtain authority over you.",

Offer verbal support.- **Don’t touch the resident.**\nPlacing your hands on someone should only be used as a last resort and only if you are trained in a behavior support program such as GPA.",
