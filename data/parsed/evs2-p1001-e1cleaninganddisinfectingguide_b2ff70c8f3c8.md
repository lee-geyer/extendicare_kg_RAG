# Definitions

- **Cleaning**: The physical removal of foreign material (e.g., dust, soil) and organic material (e.g., blood, secretions, excretions, microorganisms). Cleaning physically removes rather than kills microorganisms. It is accomplished with water, detergents, and mechanical action. Cleaning must be performed before high-level disinfection or sterilization.

- **Contact time**: The time required for a disinfectant to remain wet on a surface for it to be effective.

- **Critical Medical Devices**: Medical devices that enter sterile tissues, including the vascular system (e.g., surgical instruments, biopsy forceps, foot care equipment, dental hand pieces, etc.). Critical medical devices present a high risk of infection if the device is contaminated with any microorganisms, including bacterial spores. Reprocessing critical devices involves meticulous cleaning followed by sterilization.

- **Decontamination**: The process of cleaning, followed by the inactivation of microorganisms, to render an object safe for handling.

- **Detergent**: A synthetic cleansing agent that can emulsify oil and suspend soil. A detergent contains surfactants that do not precipitate in hard water and may also contain protease enzymes (see Enzymatic Cleaner) and whitening agents.

- **Disinfectant**: A chemical agent that kills most disease-producing microorganisms, but not necessarily bacterial spores. Disinfectants are applied only to inanimate objects. Some products combine a cleaner with a disinfectant.

- **Disinfection**: A process that kills most disease-producing microorganisms. Disinfection does not destroy all bacterial spores. Medical devices must be cleaned thoroughly before effective disinfection can take place. There are three levels of disinfection: high, intermediate, and low.

- **Drug Identification Number (DIN)**: In Canada, disinfectants are regulated as drugs under the Food and Drugs Act. Disinfectant manufacturers obtain a drug identification number (DIN) from Health Canada prior to marketing, which ensures that labeling and supporting data have been provided and that the product has undergone and passed a review of its formulation, labeling, and instructions for use.

- **Enzymatic Cleaner**: A cleaning agent that contains enzymes which break down proteins such as blood, body fluids, secretions, and excretions from surfaces and equipment. Most enzymatic cleaners also contain detergent. Enzymatic cleaners are used to loosen and dissolve organic substances.

- **High-Level Disinfection (HLD)**: A process capable of killing vegetative bacteria, mycobacteria including *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, fungi, and lipid and nonlipid viruses, as well as some, but not necessarily high numbers of, bacterial spores. High-level disinfection is the minimum level of disinfection required for semi-critical medical devices.
```

```markdown
# Definitions

## High-Touch Surfaces
Equipment and fixtures that are frequently contacted by hands (e.g., doorknobs, elevator buttons, telephones, call bells, handrails, light switches, toilet flushes, monitoring equipment, IV infusion pump, overbed table, and privacy curtains).

## Low-Level Disinfection (LLD)
A process capable of killing most vegetative bacteria, some viruses, and some fungi. This class of disinfection cannot be relied on to kill micro-organisms such as mycobacteria, including M. tuberculosis, or bacterial spores. Level of disinfection required when processing non-critical medical devices and some environmental surfaces.

## Manufacturer’s Instructions For Use (MIFU)
The written directions provided by the manufacturer or distributor of a product that contain the necessary information for the safe and effective use of the product.

## Medical Device
Any instrument, apparatus, appliance, material, or other article, whether used alone or in combination, intended by the manufacturer to be used for human beings for the purpose of diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment, or alleviation of disease, injury, or handicap; investigation, replacement, or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological process; or control of conception.

## Non-Critical Medical Device
Devices that either touch only intact skin (but not mucous membranes) or do not directly touch the client/patient/resident. Reprocessing of noncritical devices involves cleaning and may also require low-level disinfection (e.g., blood pressure cuffs, stethoscopes).

## One-Way Workflow
The practice of ensuring that reprocessing work flows in one direction from the dirtiest to the cleanest to prevent contamination.

## Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Clothing and equipment that is worn or used to provide protection against hazardous substances or environments.

## Reusable
A term given by the manufacturer of medical devices that allows it, through the selection of materials and/or components, to be re-used.

## Semi-Critical Medical Device
Medical device that contacts non-intact skin or mucous membranes but does not penetrate them (e.g., respiratory therapy equipment, transrectal probes, specula). Reprocessing semi-critical devices involves meticulous cleaning followed by, at a minimum, high-level disinfection.

## Sharps
Any item capable of cutting or piercing the skin (e.g., injection needles, trocars, cautery tips, scalpel blades, drill bits, saw blades, shavers).

## Single-Use/Disposable
A device designated by the manufacturer for single-use only. Single-use devices shall not be reprocessed.

## Sterilization
A validated process used to render a product free from viable microorganisms. This is the level of reprocessing required for critical medical devices. Devices must be cleaned thoroughly before sterilization can take place.
```

# The Basics of Cleaning and Disinfecting

The spread of infection can be directly associated with the home’s environment and care equipment. Cleaning and disinfecting equipment and surfaces are key elements of breaking the chain of infection and protecting our residents.

Cleaning is the removal of visible soil (e.g., organic and inorganic material) from objects and surfaces and normally is accomplished manually or mechanically using water with detergents or enzymatic products. Thorough cleaning is essential before any high-level disinfection and sterilization because inorganic and organic materials that remain on the surfaces interfere with these processes.

Disinfecting, however, is the inactivation of disease-producing micro-organisms. Surfaces or equipment can harbor these germs.

## CLEAN THEN DISINFECT

Environmental decontamination plays an important role in decreasing bioburden, which may help lower rates of healthcare-associated infections. Environmental surfaces include noncritical items as designated by the Spaulding Classification System as well as high-touch surfaces.

All surfaces and equipment must be routinely cleaned and disinfected to prevent the spread of germs and diseases. This includes cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces, including:

- Doorknobs
- Medical carts
- Handrails
- Call bell cords
- Counters
- Tables
- Phones
- Personal care wipe packages

----

**PAGE 5**

# Disinfecting Guidelines

Follow these guidelines when disinfecting:

- Use disinfectant solution or wipe from the correct classification.
- Use fresh disinfectant solutions. Once mixed and to ensure the solution remains “fresh”, follow the manufacturer’s instructions.
- Do not “top up” the solution. If the container is reusable, wash using hot soapy water, rinse and air dry before refilling.
- Always check the disinfectant expiry date on the container.
- Use the correct concentration of the disinfectant. Read the manufacturer’s label and the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) and follow the dilution/mixing directions.
- Ensure that the disinfectant is left on the surface for sufficient contact time. Read and follow the correct contact time listed on the manufacturer’s label (see fillable Contact Time Poster in Tools).
- Rinse the chemical residue thoroughly with water and allow it to dry as indicated by manufacturer’s instructions.
- The appropriate PPE must be utilized when handling disinfectants. Always consult the product’s SDS for required PPE.

> “Cleaning is always essential prior to disinfection or sterilization. An item that has not been cleaned cannot be assuredly disinfected or sterilized. Failure to use disinfection products or processes appropriately has repeatedly been associated with the transmission of healthcare associated infections.”
> — Public Health Agency of Canada

# Manufacturer’s Instructions for Use (MIFU)

MIFU are the written directions provided by the manufacturer or distributor of a product that contain the necessary information for the safe and effective use of the product. The MIFU is available for the disinfectant being used, and for the equipment that is being disinfected. Following the MIFU when cleaning and disinfecting ensures that:

1. The disinfectant being used is appropriate for the equipment on which it is being used.
2. The desired results for the cleaning and disinfection are achieved.
3. The equipment being disinfected is not damaged because of inappropriate cleaning and disinfection.
4. Staff are performing cleaning and disinfection tasks safely.

MIFU must be readily available and accessible to staff. All staff must:

1. Be educated on the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for the disinfectant they are using (i.e., how to use the disinfectant safely and appropriately).
2. Know the MIFU for the equipment being disinfected (i.e., how to clean and disinfect the equipment properly).
3. Be able to demonstrate their ability to follow the MIFU for which they were trained.

# Cleaning and Disinfecting Equipment

## The Spaulding Classification System

The Spaulding Classification System divides medical equipment into three categories based on risk – critical, semi-critical, and non-critical – and continues to be the primary principle that guides disinfection and sterilization processes. Correctly applying The Spaulding Classification to medical devices is a key part of keeping residents safe from infections. It is important to recognize there are differences between disinfection levels and sterilization.

### Spaulding’s Classification of Medical Equipment/Devices and Required Level of Processing/Reprocessing¹

| Classification of Equipment/Device | Definition                                                  | Level of Processing/Reprocessing | Examples                                      |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **CRITICAL**                        | Equipment/device that enters sterile tissues, including the vascular system | Cleaning followed by sterilization | - Surgical instruments
- Implants
- Biopsy instruments
- Foot care equipment
- Eye and dental equipment |
| **SEMI-CRITICAL**                  | Equipment/device that contacts non-intact skin or mucous membranes but does not penetrate them | Cleaning followed by High Level Disinfection (as a minimum)
Sterilization is preferred | - Respiratory therapy Equipment
- Anaesthesia equipment
- Tonometer |
| **NON-CRITICAL**                   | Equipment/device that touches only intact skin or does not directly touch the resident | Cleaning followed by Low-Level Disinfection | - ECG machines
- Oximeters
- Bedpans, urinals, commodes |

# Non-Critical and Critical Medical Devices and Equipment

Non-critical items can be divided into two categories:

1. **Non-critical resident care equipment** such as:
- Stethoscopes
- Bedpans
- Blood pressure cuffs
- Crutches
- Bed rails
- Poles
- Monitors
- Wheelchairs
- Linens

2. **Non-critical environmental surfaces** such as:
- Counters
- Sinks
- Bedside tables
- Resident furniture
- Floors

## Critical Medical Devices and Equipment

Critical medical devices and equipment are not reprocessed in Extendicare’s Long-Term Care homes. However, where contracted services are provided in a home (i.e., chiropody, podiatry, dental hygiene, dentistry, and wound care), a contract for the service must be provided. Contracted service providers must have a process for sterilizing all critical medical devices and equipment used for resident care.

A **Medical Devices and Equipment Reprocessing Checklist** must be completed quarterly by the contracted service provider. The IPAC Home Lead will inspect the sterilized packaging and sterilization indicators quarterly to ensure the integrity of the packaging is maintained. Refer to the policy, **Reprocessing of Critical Medical Devices/Equipment**.

### Resident Care Equipment

The cleaning and disinfecting processes for resident care depend on the type of equipment, its use, and the diversity of solutions for cleaning and disinfecting. Follow these guidelines when cleaning:

1. Replace cleaning solution when contaminated by urine, feces, or other body fluids, or when visibly soiled.
2. Clean and disinfect equipment contaminated by urine, feces, or other body fluids before re-using.
3. Change cleaning cloths if they have been in contact with blood, urine, feces, body fluids, and other potentially infectious materials.
4. Clean from least to most contaminated areas to prevent cross-contamination.
5. Apply an approved cleaner to the cloth (do not spray) and then clean the area, removing all visible soil. Do not double-dip cloths or mops.

# Cleaning and Disinfecting Shared Equipment

Shared resident care equipment must be cleaned and disinfected appropriately to limit the spread of infection. Non-critical equipment that only contacts intact skin (e.g., glucometers, stethoscopes, blood pressure cuffs, commode chair, lifts, etc.) are to be cleaned first then disinfected using a facility-approved disinfectant (e.g., Oxivir TB wipes).

Semi-Critical and critical equipment that contacts non-intact skin (e.g., wound care equipment) or enters sterile cavities (e.g., catheters), respectively, must be disposed of after use. Such equipment is considered single-use only and must not be re-used once taken out of the package.

> **Note:** Extendicare does not perform on-site high-level disinfection or sterilization due to the labor-intensive requirements that accompany both processes (e.g., enhanced ventilation and design, in-depth quality control protocols, highly technical preventive maintenance of equipment, etc.).

## Process for Cleaning and Disinfecting Shared Non-Critical Equipment

1. See dilution strengths for detergents or cleaner-disinfectants following manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Clean and disinfect all shared non-critical equipment prior to and after use.
3. Inspect device/equipment for damage such as cracks on the surface that might prevent the item from being properly cleaned and disinfected.
4. Conduct a Point of Care Risk Assessment (PCRA) and follow Routine Practices when cleaning and disinfecting the device/equipment.
5. Perform hand hygiene prior to cleaning and disinfecting the device/equipment using alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) or hand washing with soap and warm running water.
6. Wear gloves when cleaning and disinfecting a device/equipment to protect hands from harsh cleaners or disinfectant if indicated on the SDS.
```

```markdown
# Cleaning and Disinfection Procedures

## Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Guidelines

1. Put on personal protective equipment (PPE) if a PCRA indicates there is a risk of splashes or sprays while cleaning and/or disinfecting a device/equipment.
2. When cleaning/wiping the device/equipment, use friction/pressure to remove dirt, debris, or soil from the device/equipment.
3. Follow the recommended contact time ensuring that the device/equipment remains wet with the product until the contact time is achieved.
4. Allow the product to air dry on the device/equipment. Do not wipe dry.
5. Dispose of used cleaner/disinfectant wipes in the garbage.
6. Remove PPE once cleaning and disinfection of the device/equipment has been completed and perform hand hygiene.

### Reminders
- Always use fresh cleaning water/solution.
- Clean cloths must be used and replaced when contaminated.
- Always clean from the least contaminated to the most contaminated area.
- Use multiple cloths, and never double-dip cloths or mops into the cleaning water/solution.
- Do not use spray bottles for applying cleaner/disinfectant directly onto devices/equipment as this will aerosolize the product. Pour the product onto a cloth or directly on the surface.

## Disinfectant Wipes

Prepackaged disinfectant wipes can be used by staff to clean and disinfect devices/equipment/surfaces. When using disinfectant wipes:

1. The active ingredient must be appropriate for the devices/equipment/surfaces and the type of organism needing to be killed or destroyed.
2. Wipes must be kept wet and discarded if they become dry.
3. Wipes must have a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) and be used according to it (e.g., PPE use, if recommended).
4. Disinfectant wipes are used for devices/equipment/surfaces that will not tolerate soaking and small items that must be disinfected between each resident at the point of care (e.g., stethoscope).
5. When using wipes for disinfection of large pieces of equipment (e.g., lifts), multiple wipes are required to allow the device/equipment to stay wet for the appropriate contact time.
```

```markdown
# Storage of Clean and Disinfected Shared Equipment

After every resident use, all shared equipment must be cleaned and disinfected, and then stored in a dedicated clean area away from sources of contamination. A dedicated clean area should be:

- Away from areas of high foot traffic and resident pathways (e.g., not in hallways);
- Protected from dust and moisture and supplies are stored off the floor and away from sources of contamination (e.g., garbage bins, laundry hampers, soiled utility rooms, garbage chute room, leaks, etc.);
- Easily accessible to staff (e.g., be on the same floor, if feasible); and
- Labelled/designated as a ‘Clean Area’.

The following areas must not be used for storage of clean/disinfected shared equipment:

- Soiled utility rooms
- Tub and shower rooms
- Resident rooms and/or bathrooms
- Bathrooms and toileting facilities
- Garbage rooms
- The dirty side of laundry rooms
- Boiler rooms and other maintenance rooms

Clean/disinfected shared equipment should be stored in a dedicated room/area, with doors that can be closed to limit access. However, if this is not possible, other measures can be taken to dedicate a clean area such as:

1. Utilizing wipeable barriers (e.g., plastic sheets or Plexiglass) to separate a dedicated area from the rest of the space (e.g., dedicating a corner to clean equipment);
2. Placing clean covers on the cleaned and disinfected equipment if they must be stored in an area where there is high foot traffic (e.g., hallways);
3. Storing sources of contamination away from areas where the disinfected equipment would normally be stored (e.g., moving laundry hampers, garbage bins, and other sources of contamination away from the equipment); and
4. Placing signage dedicating an area for storage of clean and disinfected equipment, to inform staff and visitors.

> **Note:** If your home does not have an adequate space for storage of disinfected shared equipment, reach out to the IPAC Consultant team for assistance.
```

```markdown
# TIP
You can introduce a 2-colour visual tagging system (e.g., red & green tags) to alert staff to which equipment has been disinfected and can be stored away, and which is still in need of disinfection. For example, tag equipment with green if it has been disinfected and is ready to be stored in a clean, dedicated area or tag it red if it is still in need of cleaning and disinfection. Please note that this system works only if you have a dedicated clean area for storage of disinfected equipment (i.e., the disinfected equipment cannot be stored in areas that are easily accessible to residents/families/visitors where they are constantly prone to contamination, such as hallways).

## Cleaning and Disinfecting Personal Care Equipment
All dedicated and non-dedicated personal care equipment must be cleaned and disinfected after use to prevent the buildup and spread of pathogens. All personal care equipment must be in a good state of repair. All dedicated personal care items (e.g., nail clippers) must be labelled with the resident’s name and be used only for that resident. Follow IPAC Manual policy, **Personal Care Equipment: Cleaning and Disinfecting** for cleaning and disinfection procedures for personal care equipment.

Resident personal care equipment (e.g., urinals) must never be washed and cleaned in the resident’s sink. This practice can lead to contaminating the resident’s sink or personal items (toothbrush, dentures, glasses) resulting in the spread of pathogens, in addition to increasing splash and spray, which may contaminate the staff.

The cleaning and disinfecting of personal care equipment should be completed in a Soiled Utility Room. Staff must cover the soiled personal care equipment while transporting the equipment to the soiled utility room (e.g., by placing the equipment in a garbage bag and securing it).
```

# Setting Up Soiled Utility Rooms

The Soiled Utility Room is where cleaning and disinfection of personal care items (e.g., bedpans, commode basins, etc.) should take place. The room is equipped with the facilities that allow the appropriate disposal of bodily fluids and gross soiling, with minimum aerosolization and, consequently, prevent contamination of the staff performing the cleaning and disinfection.

For staff to effectively use the Soiled Utility Room for cleaning and disinfection (as outlined in policy, **Personal Care Equipment: Cleaning and Disinfecting**), the set-up of the room must support the one-way workflow for staff. Decontamination work areas shall be physically separated from clean and other work areas to control traffic flow and to isolate contaminants generated during the stages of cleaning. Walls or partitions should be cleaned regularly and be constructed of materials that can withstand cleaning and disinfection.

## A Soiled Utility Room should be set up and maintained as follows:

1. Declutter the room and keep it clear of unnecessary equipment.
2. One-way workflow of staff.
3. Adequate space for the cleaning process and storage of necessary equipment and supplies.
4. Surfaces that can be easily cleaned and disinfected.
5. Minimize the number of items on working surfaces (e.g., countertops) and the surrounding areas.
6. Keep doors closed to prevent cross contamination and locked to prevent resident access.
7. Remove and discard all spray wands as they have been associated with aerosolization of infectious materials.
8. Included in the routine cleaning schedule.
9. Easy access to hand washing facilities (e.g., a dedicated sink, soap, paper towels). The hand hygiene sink must be used for handwashing and no other purpose. Signage can be placed at the sink, dedicating it for hand hygiene only.

> **Note:** If the room design does not support such facilities, please reach out to the IPAC Consultant team to help you with finding the best available solution.

----

**PAGE 14**

# Infection Control Policy

## Decontamination and Hand Hygiene

1. A clear distinction between the areas used for decontamination (i.e., cleaning and disinfecting) and areas used for hand hygiene (i.e., dedicated hand hygiene sinks).
2. PPE must be readily available inside the room (face shield, mask, gown, and gloves). PPE must be stored in a clean, protected area in the room.
3. Brushes and disinfectants must be available in the soiled utility room.
4. Disinfectant solution remains “fresh”, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Do not “top up” the solution.

The area where dirty devices/equipment are to be cleaned must not cross-contaminate into an area where clean equipment is stored. This may be a work area that is physically separated from clean areas and other work areas by walls or partitions to control traffic flow and to contain contaminants generated during the stages of cleaning and disinfection. A wipeable physical barrier (e.g., a plexiglass) can be placed between the hopper and other areas (e.g., countertops, sinks, etc.) to maintain physical separation between clean and dirty.

## Storing Cleaned and Disinfected Items

Cleaned and disinfected items must never be stored in the Soiled Utility Room. This includes:
- Commode
- Bedpans
- Basins
- Resident personal items (e.g., nail clippers)

All clean and disinfected items are to be stored in the resident’s room or in a Clean Utility Room.

# Environmental Cleaning

Contaminated surfaces and equipment contribute to the transmission of microorganisms and to the burden of health care-associated infection. Good environmental cleaning practices are essential for reducing the risk of transmitting infectious diseases. Environmental cleaning in the home should be performed on a routine basis to provide a safe and sanitary environment.

High-touch surfaces in care areas require more frequent cleaning and disinfection than other contact surfaces. Low-touch surfaces require cleaning on a regular basis, when soiling or spills occur, and when a resident is discharged from the home. Refer to policy, **Cleaning Frequency in the Housekeeping and Laundry Services Manual** for recommended cleaning frequencies and a risk stratification matrix.

When cleaning and disinfecting the health care environment, work from clean to dirty (to avoid moving dirt and microorganisms from dirty areas to cleaner areas) and from high to low (to avoid having dirt or microorganisms drip down and re-contaminate areas already cleaned).

## Cleaning in Areas of Active Construction

Construction activities generate dust and contaminants that may pose a risk to residents, staff, or visitors in the LTC home. Infection prevention and control must assess construction and maintenance projects during planning, work, and after completion to verify that infection prevention and control requirements are followed throughout the process.

Cleaning is of particular importance both during construction and after completion of the construction project. What is considered clean may be interpreted differently by contractors and health care workers. Work surfaces may be wiped clean by construction workers, but other cleaning performed by construction workers inside the construction zone include:

1. Floor sweeping to remove debris.
2. Vacuuming of walk-off mats.
3. Replacing mats regularly and as required.
4. Removing construction debris (e.g., large pieces of drywall, wiring).
```

# Cleaning

## Quality Assurance

Auditing the environmental cleaning within the home is part of the continuous quality improvement process. Effective auditing will help ensure resident well-being and comfort, while also promoting infection prevention and control standards within the home.

Environmental marking measures the thoroughness of cleaning by using a tracing agent to mark items and environmental surfaces prior to cleaning. Following cleaning, an observer can assess the marked surfaces using a detecting agent that allows visualization of the tracing agent to determine whether they were cleaned.

### Environmental Marking Auditing Systems

There are three environmental marking auditing systems available to Extendicare homes:

- **Watch ASSURE SYSTEM video** by clicking the YouTube icon.
- The Cleaning Audit/Tracking Form is available in tools and can be used with both ASSURE (Foam) System and with GLO GERM (Fluorescence).

- **Watch DIVERSEY VERICLEAN video** by clicking the YouTube icon.

- **Watch GLO GERM SURFACE DETECTION GEL video** by clicking the YouTube icon.
