The evacuees should be gathered and led in groups or in single file. Once the ambulatory residents have been evacuated, all other residents can be assisted.- **Non-ambulatory residents** may be evacuated by wheelchair or by other wheeled conveyance. This is easiest and fastest for covering a distance but requires transferring the resident to a chair. Residents can be pulled from the bed onto a blanket and pulled along the floor. Blankets are usually readily available, but carpeted hallways make this very difficult. In this case, if two or more carriers are available, the blankets can be used as an improvised stretcher.As a care facility, detailed files of each resident are maintained and kept readily available in the event of an emergency.
