# PROCEDURE

## SECTION: Privacy and Confidentiality
### DESCRIPTION: Information Safeguards
### INDEX: PRV1-P10.07

For awareness, Extendicare deploys the following technical safeguards:

- Extendicare users are assigned a user ID to authenticate and restrict access to data and applications required for their role. Privileges are restricted to the least amount of PHI required for their functional role and that can be reasonably accommodated by the specific information system. The use of another person’s assigned User ID is prohibited.

- Passwords meet or exceed the minimum requirements of the system for which they are used. They are a combination of alphanumeric characters that cannot be easily guessed and are kept confidential at all times and should not be written down, posted publicly or shared with other staff.

- PHI is not sent by email or transmitted over external networks, including internet and wireless networks, without being encrypted and must contain a confidentiality notification.

- PHI is stored only on designated network drives.

- Extendicare deploys firewalls, intrusion detection software, and other technical means to protect internal Extendicare networks carrying identifiable PHI from unauthorized use and malicious software.

- Extendicare and its service providers complete audits as required by provincial legislation.

- Conducts privacy impact assessments to assess potential risks to Extendicare’s network and PHI e.g., introduction of a new health information repository.

> **Note:** Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) are required in the province of Alberta and must be submitted to the Alberta Privacy Commissioner’s Office upon completion.
