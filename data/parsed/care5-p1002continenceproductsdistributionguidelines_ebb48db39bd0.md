## POLICY

### Continence Care Program

----

## PROCEDURE

- Preferred vendor resources (e.g., vendor binders) will be accessible in an area designated by the home for the continence team to utilize, to ensure the most appropriate product selection and sizing for residents requiring continence products.
- Product selection will be determined according to the residents’ individual needs and preferences and through consultation with the residents and vendors where applicable (i.e., bariatric, or anatomical considerations).
- Further collaboration with the preferred vendor will occur to discuss product usage, review or conduct audits, or facilitate staff education as required.
- The Continence Lead/designate will manage a product order calculator as per vendor recommendations to track inventory, update individual resident orders and ensure an adequate quantity for supply.
- Procurement of continent products will be conducted weekly through Extendicare’s preferred distributor following review and revision to the order calculator.
- The home will have a process for the safe storage of continent products, ensuring protection from external or environmental elements (e.g., moisture).

### Distribution:

- The home will have a systematic product distribution process in place using a current resident list, outlining correct product(s), including size and quantity as determined by individual assessed needs and preferences.
- Where products are distributed to the resident’s room, they will be placed in a designated location as agreed upon by the resident and/or Substitute Decision Maker/Power of Attorney (e.g., closet, wardrobe) and in accordance with provincial regulations.
- Products separate from the bulk supply will be available in a designated location as determined by the home for staff to access, and the Continence Product Utilization Sheet will be completed when additional products are required to support evaluation of any change in the resident’s continence care needs.
