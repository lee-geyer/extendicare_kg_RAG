# CODE WHITE
## Emergency Response - Violent Situation

### What does it mean?
Code White is the phrase used to alert staff to any aggressive or violent situation. Staff need to call a Code White when facing a situation that makes them feel unsafe or creates a fear of violence due to the behaviour of another person. The goal is to preserve everybody’s safety, and to address the behaviour in a safe, respectful, and caring manner.

### What do I do?
If you are involved in a Code White incident:
- Remain calm and leave the area if able to do so
- If you cannot leave, maintain a safe distance from the aggressor
- Call for help and announce 3 times, “Code White + location” if able
- Talk in a low non-threatening voice. Clearly and firmly tell the aggressor that his/her behaviour is unacceptable, unwelcome and they should stop
- If a resident is involved, employ responsive behaviour management strategies as outlined in the plan of care
- Listen and give the aggressor the opportunity to express their feelings or demands, and try other means to diffuse the situation (refer to Code White De-escalation Techniques)

If you discover a Code White Incident:
- Announce 3 times, “Code White + location”
- If the situation puts the safety of residents, staff or visitors at risk, immediately call 9-1-1
- Remove other individuals from the area for their own safety. Reduce traffic by closing door in affected area.
- The staff member who has the best relationship with the aggressor should handle the situation, if applicable and safe to do so
- Ask other staff to help as required and call 9-1-1 as appropriate
- When the emergency is over, announce 3 times “Code White all clear”

### Review it before you need it:
- Refer to your Home’s Emergency Planning and Management Manual, Code White
- Review the Code White plan and checklist that describes your area’s role if a Code White occurs
