## POLICY

### Restorative Care

### PROCEDURE

Extendicare is committed to providing a coordinated interdisciplinary approach to restorative programming and interventions as part of the restorative care philosophy. This approach ensures all residents have access to individualized restorative services focused on optimizing functional abilities, enhancing independence, and improving quality of life.

- Restorative care programming and interventions must be determined through a coordinated approach, as outlined in procedural standards and roles and responsibilities.
- The home must establish a Restorative Care Coordinating Committee (RCCC) to ensure a structured, interdisciplinary approach to restorative care planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation.
- The Associate Director of Care and the Recreation Manager or their designates will co-lead the RCCC and coordinate meetings in accordance with the Restorative Care Coordinating Committee - Terms of Reference.
- Nurses are to initiate an RCCC referral based on interRAI assessment triggers, or as necessary (e.g., increased falls, mood changes, respiratory issues), where restorative potential is identified.

### Associate Director of Care/Designate Responsibilities

- Review and triage referrals in a timely manner using the Restorative Needs Assessment & Evaluation to determine program eligibility.
- Facilitate RCCC meetings to discuss assessment outcomes, and identify appropriate restorative care streams (e.g., exercise, mobility, feeding, cognitive engagement).
- Collaborate with therapists (PT, OT, SLP, Respiratory Therapy, Social Work) to align nursing interventions with therapeutic goals.
- Provide oversight of restorative nursing interventions to ensure alignment with clinical best practices.
- Ensure that nursing staff, unregulated care providers, and Restorative Aides receive training on the restorative care philosophy, policy, procedures, and nursing rehabilitation techniques.
- Monitor and evaluate program metrics and quality indicators related to functional outcomes.
- Ensure accurate documentation of therapy minutes in the resident health record.

## SECTION: Restorative Care
### DESCRIPTION: Restorative Programming
### INDEX: CARE15-P10.01

----

### Recreation Manager/Designate Responsibilities

- Integrate restorative principles into recreation, leisure, and well-being programs.
- Design activities that promote mobility, cognitive engagement, and daily living skills aligned with each resident’s goals.
- Identify meaningful engagement opportunities and ensure recreation staff are trained to adapt programming to meet residents’ functional and psychosocial needs.

#### Additional Assessments
- Additional assessments may be required to determine restorative potential (e.g., nutritional assessment for weight loss, PT assessment for mobility issues).
- The RCCC must have access to the Restorative Care Programs Guide to determine eligibility and ensure informed evidence-based decisions for restorative programming.
- Individualized goals must be identified in collaboration with the resident or Substitute Decision Maker (SDM)/POA, including consent to participate in restorative programs. Residents have the right to refuse participation, and such decisions must be documented with follow-up reviewed at RCCC meetings.
- The interdisciplinary team, resident, and/or SDM/POA must mutually establish the plan of care. Restorative programming and interventions must be implemented and documented within the resident’s care plan, according to regulatory requirements.
- The RCCC must monitor progress and make interdisciplinary care recommendations. Updates to restorative programming will be communicated and documented, including informing front-line staff and the SDM/POA, where applicable.
- Progress toward restorative goals must be evaluated and documented on the Restorative Needs Assessment & Evaluation at least quarterly, or more often as needed. This evaluation will include effectiveness of strategies, recommendations for modifications, transition plans, or discharge from the restorative program.
- All restorative care must be delivered in a trauma-informed, culturally appropriate manner that respects resident dignity, autonomy, and individual preferences.
