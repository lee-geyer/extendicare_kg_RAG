## Tray Service Guideline

The guideline below was developed to support staff during delivery of snacks and meals to residents under isolation.

### Meal Service Reminders:
- All staff must don PPE prior to entering room, regardless of task to complete.
- If a resident has a roommate, PPE must be changed between roommates.
- Always move from well residents to ill residents, to reduce exposure.
- Always offer each resident hand hygiene before and after each meal.
- Use tray cart/cart from kitchen to deliver and pick up meal trays.
- Wipe cart with disinfectant wipes before leaving the unit.

### Passing trays alone:
1. Perform hand hygiene and bring tray cart close to resident doorway.
2. Perform hand hygiene and put on ALL PPE.
3. Take tray from cart and enter resident’s room, set up as usual (tray can remain in room).
4. Come out of room and doff PPE, perform hand hygiene, and move to next room.

### Passing trays in a team:
1. Staff #1 remains in the hallway, performs hand hygiene to pass trays/drinks from the cart.
2. Staff #2 will perform hand hygiene and don ALL PPE and enter the resident room.
3. Staff #1 passes tray to Staff #2 who sets up meal tray and/or assists resident.
4. Staff perform hand hygiene, doff, and move to next room.

**Please note:** If the Resident requires assistance with meals, the meal tray should not be provided until assistance with feeding (as required for the Resident) is available.

### Clean-up After Meals:
#### Collecting trays alone:
1. Staff moves tray cart to doorway, performs hand hygiene, dons PPE and enters room, collects trays and places on cart at doorway.
2. Staff doffs PPE and performs hand hygiene and moves to next room.

#### Collection trays in teams:
Follow delivery method from above with one staff entering the room and one staff in hallway to collect trays.
