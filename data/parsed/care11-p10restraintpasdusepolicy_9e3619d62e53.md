## POLICY

Extendicare is committed to reducing dependency on any type of restrictive device through the utilization of alternative approaches that prioritize the safety, dignity, autonomy, and quality of life of all residents.

## STANDARD

Protocols for the use of restraints and PASDs are designed in consultation with Health and Safety and Restorative committees to prioritize resident safety, uphold dignity, and promote independence in daily living.

- Devices where the resident has the cognitive and physical capacity to release or remove are not considered a restraint.
- With respect to this policy, electronic tracking devices (e.g., wander guard bracelets) are not considered a restraint.
- Restraining measures will not be utilized for the purpose of staff convenience or as a form of discipline in response to a resident’s specific behaviour.
- In accordance with legislative and provincial regulatory requirements, the following devices are prohibited in all homes:
- Roller bars on wheelchairs, commodes, or toilets;
- Any device used to restrain a resident to a commode or toilet;
- Vest, jacket, or four-point extremity restraints;
- Any device with locks that can only be released by a separate device;
- Sheets or other types of strips or bandages used other than for therapeutic purposes;
- Any device that cannot be immediately released by staff.
- Environmental restraints involving barriers to a resident’s personal movement through confinement to specific areas will not be permitted. Examples include, but are not limited to:
- Removal of a mobility aid (e.g., walker, cane, or wheelchair);
- Locking wheelchair brakes to prevent the resident from freely wheeling away;
- Restricting a resident to a room (e.g., locking the door, placing a barrier in the doorway, which they are unable to remove).
- Restraints will only be considered as a last resort to mitigate the risk a resident may pose to self or others and only after other viable options have been trialed and determined ineffective and clearly documented in the resident health record.
- Personal Assistance Service Devices (PASD) will be used to assist a resident in activities of daily living (ADLs) and should not restrict freedom of movement or independence.

# POLICY

## SECTION: Restraint & PASD Use
### DESCRIPTION: Restraint and PASD Use
### INDEX: CARE11-P10

- If a PASD does limit or inhibit freedom of movement when in use during the ADL task, it will not be classified as a restraint, unless the device remains in use beyond the duration of the ADL activity, which would then classify the device as a restraint.
- The least restrictive device possible, whether classified as a restraint or PASD, will be implemented and utilized in accordance with manufacturers’ instructions and for the shortest duration possible.
- Prior to the implementation of any restraint or PASD, assessments will be conducted to determine the resident’s functional health status, including any precipitating factors that may necessitate the need for a device, alternatives, and any resident/SDM/POA considerations.
- If a restraint or PASD is determined necessary, informed consent from the capable resident and/or SDM/POA will be obtained related to the device, expected benefits, potential risks, and alternatives, to the exception of emergency restraints where according to common law duty consent is not required in an immediate effort to prevent serious bodily harm.
- In accordance with legislative and provincial and health authority regulations, an order will be obtained for the implementation of a restraint or PASD by an approved health care professional (e.g., physician, nurse practitioner) which will include the type of device and specifications for use, including target duration.
- Use of a restraint or PASD will support the best interest of the resident and be consistent with the overall therapeutic goal, which will be documented in the plan of care, along with the effect the device has, and how and when the device is to be implemented, released, or removed.
- Residents utilizing restraints and/or PASDs will be monitored daily in accordance with legislative and provincial health authority regulations. Monitoring will include assessing for signs of discomfort, injury, or potential complications, ensuring routine release, repositioning, and care, and evaluating the use of alternative strategies whenever possible.
- Evaluation of residents utilizing restraints and/or PASDs will be conducted and include the resident’s response, need for continued use, consideration for alternatives, and a plan for a restrictive device-free trial period, where appropriate prior to the discontinuation.
- The Director of Care/Assistant Director of Care designate will be responsible for reviewing and discussing Extendicare’s Restraint & PASD policy and procedures with the capable resident and/or SDM/POA in relation to the resident’s history, including any prior safety risks upon move-in to the long-term care home and upon device consideration.
- The DOC/ADOC designate will oversee the program and complete a monthly analysis and annual program evaluation related to restraint and PASD utilization and ensure compliance with standards set out in policy and procedure.
- Additionally, the DOC/ADOC designate will support the education of all staff providing resident care through ongoing education as required, upon hire and at minimum annually.
