1. **Confirmation of Authorization:**
- The person making the request must be:
- the Resident (if they are capable); or
- if the resident is not capable, the resident’s Substitute Decision Maker.

2. **Documentation:**
- Documentation must be on file or produced to confirm status (e.g., Power of Attorney document, will), if applicable.

3. **Timely Access:**
- Provide access to or copies of the medical record as soon as possible within 30 days of receiving the request. Contact the Privacy Office for all requests requiring a time extension beyond 30 days.

5. **Secure Transmission:**
