Code Orange is the designated phrase to alert and notify staff of the need to prepare for or respond to a disaster external to the home that is causing residents/patients from another facility to be relocated to this home, which is likely to exceed available resources, staffing levels, require additional or extraordinary assistance, or possible multi-site responses.#### What do I do? Once the home has been notified of additional incoming residents:\n- Use the Code Orange Incident Manager checklist to gather all pertinent information and prepare for their arrival. - Notify the Executive Director/Designate and Regional Director \"Code Orange\" (if residents are expected to arrive in less than 3 hours, announce 3 times; if they are arriving in more than 3 hours, no announcement is necessary). - Initiate the Incident Management System and assign roles. - Initiate the staff call back process if required. - Establish an in-home receiving area. - Set up a Family Information Support Centre.#### Review it before you need it:\n- Refer to your Home's Emergency Planning and Management Manual Code Orange.",
