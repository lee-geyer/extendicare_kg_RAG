## Nutrition Symptom Management Through Palliative Care

Residents receiving palliative care may experience uncomfortable/distressing symptoms that may be addressed through nutrition care interventions. Common symptoms are outlined in this table with potential interventions. Not all symptoms may be experienced, and not all symptoms may respond to nutrition interventions. Some symptoms may be side effects of or exacerbated by medications – consulting with the physician and/or pharmacist is recommended.

| Symptom/Discomfort          | Stable & Transition                                                                 | End-of-Life                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Decreased appetite           | Increase food density (fortified foods), favorite foods, maximize best meal, possible oral supplement, consume high protein/calorie items first. | Consider removing or loosening resident’s diet/therapeutic interventions and possibly food texture or liquid consistency based on immediate risks/resident/SDM/POA wishes. Offer favorite foods as tolerated, encourage family to express their love in alternate ways than through food (e.g., reading, holding hands, talking, etc.). |
| Early satiety               | Smaller portions, beverages at end of meal, nutrient dense snacks, consume high protein/calorie items first. | Offer favorite foods as tolerated in small amounts.                                            |
| Weight loss, malnutrition    | Increase food density (fortified foods), favorite foods, maximize best meal, possible oral supplement, consume high protein/calorie items first. | No longer a concern.                                                                            |
| Bloating, Heartburn         | Sit up during and 30 minutes after meals, smaller meals including fluids with snacks/fluids, eat slowly. Take a break if needed, reduce high fat foods, avoid/reduce intake of legumes, gas-producing vegetables, and carbonated beverages. | If able to tolerate food and fluids, follow same suggestions.                                   |
| Constipation                | Increase fluid intake and fibre intake as tolerated. (Refer to Increasing Fibre Guidelines). | Food and fluids as tolerated. Medication may be more appropriate.                              |
|                             | Fibre-enriched hot cereal, add ground flax to yogurt or pudding to increase fibre and nutrient density. |                                                                                                |

# Nutrition Symptom Management Through Palliative Care

## Commercial fibre supplements.
- Physical activity may assist with bowel movements.

### Diarrhea/loose stools
- If severe, may require 24-hour clear fluid diet.
- Increase fluid intake – offer high fluid foods such as:
- Popsicles
- Ice chips
- Frozen juice pops
- Soup, etc. to prevent dehydration.
- Additional fluids may be better tolerated between meals or may require oral electrolyte replacement.
- May have temporary lactose intolerance.
- Encourage intake of soluble fibre from sources such as:
- Applesauce
- Banana
- Oatmeal

### Dry Mouth
- Assess fluid intake.
- If the resident is capable, hard candies or ice chips may provide relief.
- Increase frequency of mouth care including:
- Hygiene
- Lip lubrication
- Artificial saliva
- Ice chips as tolerated
- Consider artificial oral moisturizer/saliva.

### Altered taste/smell
- Identify if medication related or due to food aversions.
- Cold foods may be better tolerated.
- Add seasonings if food is too bland.

### Nausea and Vomiting
- Address constipation and fluid intake; reduce odors (may also include food).
- Smaller meals, fluid at end of meal; foods/beverages that reduce nausea are often resident specific e.g., crackers, ginger ale.
- Medication may be required to control nausea/vomiting.

### Oral thrush/ulceration
- Utilize nutrient dense cold foods, frequent sips of fluid, and increase oral care.

### Dehydration
- Address if other symptoms related to reduced intake; in addition to favorite beverages, offer high fluid foods such as:
- Popsicles
- Freezies
- Ice cream
