Give the person space. If there are multiple staff members at the scene, have one staff member attempt to de-escalate the situation while the other staff member stands behind to assist in removing the speaking staff member from any direct contact as needed. It is best if only one staff member is talking and trying to de-escalate so they do not further agitate or confuse the aggressive individual. - If the aggressive individual can be calmed, a Code White does not need to be announced, the “All Clear” will be in effect. - Review Tool 2, De-escalation Techniques for assistance on how to de-escalate an aggressive situation. - Never physically confront the agitated or aggressive individual; use action-oriented verbal communication and non-violent interventions to de-escalate the situation safely. Do not try to remove a weapon or subdue the person.",

Provide as much information as possible about the situation to the police. - Advise the Incident Manager, if possible, of the Code White situation. If the Incident Manager is not in proximity, advise a staff bystander of the Code White, identifying the location, and if a weapon is involved. - Ask the staff designate to notify the Incident Manager and ensure the Code White is announced. - If you are in the immediate area, and/or responding to the Code White, assist in evacuating residents from the area of threat, if necessary. Follow instructions from The Incident Manager.",
