## MANAGEMENT
**Date/initials**
- Initiate Contact Precautions.

- Identify close contacts, including roommates transferred to other home areas or to another facility within the previous 6 weeks. Assess close contacts for evidence of scabies.
- DOC/DHW/designate to coordinate treatment with Nurse treatment teams.
- Ongoing head to toe skin assessments x 6 weeks.

### Before treatment:
- Bag all bed linens, towels, and clothing worn by client in the previous 4 days.
- Transport bagged linen directly to laundry department and notify them in advance.
- Bag and seal in plastic bags all other clothing and items that cannot be washed (e.g., coats, boots) and segregate for 7 days or frozen at -25ᵒC for a minimum of 2 hours.
- **Typical Scabies** – routine cleaning of the room by environment services.
- **Crusted Scabies** – in addition to routine cleaning, fabric covered seating (if used) should be segregated for 4 days. Vacuuming is sufficient for carpeted areas.
- Wipe down mattress with approved disinfectant and apply clean bed linens.
- All wheelchairs, commodes, slings for lifts to be cleaned and disinfected.

### Treatment:
- Ensure client has clean dry skin and nails are trimmed prior to treatment application.
- Administer Resident treatment as per manufacturer’s direction.
- It is preferable to treat clients in the evening to ensure there is greater contact time with the skin as there is less chance the medication will be washed off.
- **Note:** Symptomatic case(s) may be treated twice, 1 week apart, and asymptomatic contacts once (prophylaxis treatment) based on the direction of a physician/nurse practitioner.
- Clean gown for client and clean bedding.

### If treatment is topical during bath:
- Strip bed, bag linens and clothing worn during treatment.
- Wipe down mattress with PMH-approved disinfectant and apply clean bed linens.
- Transport bagged linen directly to laundry department and notify them in advance.
- Clean and disinfect bathtub.
- Coordinate terminal cleaning of client’s room at same time of bath.

### Typical Scabies
- Ensure Contact Precautions remain for 24hrs after start of effective treatment and until terminal clean and/or bath is complete.
- In some instances, symptomatic cases may remain on Contact Precautions until 2nd treatment.
