This also increases the tendency for it to become more chaotic and less easy to manage. - When a piece of equipment poses a danger to workers, that equipment will be “locked-out” until repaired. Lockout ensures that a machine, or process that is shut down for maintenance, cleaning, or any other procedure, is secured against accidental start-up or movement. All staff will be made aware of this process for all equipment that needs repair. - If equipment repairs cannot be completed immediately, maintenance staff must:\na. Evaluate the risk of allowing the continued use of the equipment while it awaits repairs;\nb. Tag the defective equipment with a lock-out tag if it is deemed to be unsuitable for use;\nc.",

Either remove the tagged equipment to a secure designated area or take necessary precautions to prevent use of the equipment by residents, staff or visitors until repairs can be made;\nd. Inform the appropriate staff of the nature of the problem and any precautions taken. - The Maintenance Manager/Designate will develop a program to provide remedial maintenance to equipment and systems. They will also evaluate the program annually. - One of the ways to manage this type of maintenance is to first recognize the several types of situations that may develop and then form a plan of appropriate actions for each type. - The response to a problem may be different depending on when the problem is discovered. Problems may develop during normal operating hours when the home’s management staff and maintenance staff are in the building, or they may develop outside normal operating hours when the home’s management staff and the maintenance staff are not in the building.",
