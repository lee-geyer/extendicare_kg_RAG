      "text": "# Candida Auris (C. auris)## Resident Information\nPlease read this fact sheet and ask staff if you have any questions.### WHAT IS Candida Auris? Candida auris (also called C. auris) is a fungus that can cause serious infections. It colonizes the skin of the affected individual and can cause infection when the pathogen gains entry into the body through various sites, including the ears, wounds, and the bloodstream. People can carry C. auris somewhere on their body, even if it is not making them sick. This is called colonization.### HOW DOES C. AURIS SPREAD? C. auris can spread from one person to another. When residents in long-term care are colonized, C. auris can spread from their bodies and can get on other people by direct contact (unwashed hands). Transmission through indirect contact can also occur after touching contaminated material or equipment. Good hand hygiene and room cleaning is important because C. auris can live on surfaces for several weeks.### WHAT IS C. AURIS SO CONCERNING? - It can cause serious infections. - It is often resistant to medicines, making it difficult to treat. - It is becoming more common. - It is difficult to identify by routine lab tests.",
