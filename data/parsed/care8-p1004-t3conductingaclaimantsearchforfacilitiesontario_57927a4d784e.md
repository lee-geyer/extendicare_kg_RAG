# Claimant Search for Unclaimed Bodies

## Purpose of Document
This document provides a process for managing unclaimed bodies that were not investigated by a coroner across Ontario. The process ensures reasonable and timely efforts to locate persons who may claim a body in order to respect the dignity of a deceased person. When no claimant can be found, arrangements will be made by the Office of the Chief Coroner for the disposition of an unclaimed body pursuant to the Anatomy Act.

This document includes:
- Information on conducting a step by step reasonable next of kin (NoK)/claimant search
- Clarification on the role of the Office of the Public Guardian & Trustee (OPGT)
- Templates of key forms/letters
- A checklist/worksheet
- Important contact information

## Definition
An unclaimed body is defined in the Anatomy Act, S. 3. (1) as a body that:
a) is unclaimed by a relative or friend within twenty-four hours* after the death;
b) has not been or will not be used for a purpose authorized under the Trillium Gift of Life Act.

## Coroner vs Non-Coroner Cases of Unclaimed Bodies
Where a deceased person falls under the jurisdiction of a coroner and is potentially unclaimed, the Office of the Chief Coroner is responsible to conduct the NoK/Claimant search. Where a deceased person falls outside of the jurisdiction of a coroner, i.e. the natural or expected death of a patient/resident, the facility where the death occurred is responsible for conducting the NoK/Claimant search as outlined in this document.

* The 24 hour time-frame is not applicable within the current practice in the management of unclaimed bodies.

# Unclaimed Body Management Guidelines

## Section 1: Introduction
Section 3 of the Anatomy Act states that:
> "The person having possession of the body of a deceased person that is unclaimed shall notify the local inspector and shall furnish the local inspector with such information respecting the deceased person as is within the knowledge of the notifier and as the local inspector may require."
> R.S.O. 1990, c. A.21, s. 3 (1); 2016, c. 23, s. 35.

In June 2017, the Chief Coroner communicated with hospitals and long-term care facilities in Ontario reminding them of their responsibility to conduct a reasonable NoK/claimant search in support of the respectful disposition of an unclaimed body (Appendix A, pages 19-23). While guidance was provided about the new approach to managing these, at times, challenging situations, questions from staff at hospitals and long-term care homes prompted preparation of this document to further clarify the process required when responding to an unclaimed body.

## Section 2: Timelines
The timelines were developed to promote a prompt investigation for a NoK/Claimant, as well as timely disposition of unclaimed bodies. Use of the Decision Tree will assist with this process (Appendix B, page 24).

The time period until a body is declared unclaimed by individual hospitals, long-term care (LTC) facilities, and funeral homes will vary according to hospital morgue capacity, cold-storage capacity, and/or ability to transfer to a private storage facility. For context, the Office of the Chief Coroner (OCC) typically initiates the unclaimed body process if no claim has been made for the body ten days after the death. Once a body is declared unclaimed, there should be a 4-6 week timeline for completion of a NoK/Claimant search and disposition arrangements.

### Timeline Breakdown
- **Week 1**:
- Chart review
- Check belongings
- Contact emergency contact/NoK, family physician, OPGT client representatives (if any), police, landlord, agencies
- **Week 2-5**:
- OPGT Estates referral and response
- **Week 6**:
- Refer to Regional Supervising Coroner’s Office with all required documentation

Attendance at the residence when the belongings are present may assist police with identifying a suitable NoK/Claimant. This should be facilitated soon after the death as in some cases, the deceased person may have lived in a rental property and their belongings may be removed from their residence after approximately 30 days.

# Conducting a Claimant Search

Use the Claimant Search Worksheet to guide and record the details of your NoK/Claimant search (Appendix D, pages 27-29).

## Review the Patient Record

Review the patient record for any documentation about a NoK/Claimant. Key documents include the admission sheet, care provider notes, and a list of visitors. Review any documentation from previous admissions to your facility.

- Contact any/all emergency contacts, agencies involved past or present, e.g., Home care providers, shelter personnel, visitors/friends.
- Note the address of the deceased person
- Complete an internet search on the address if it is an apartment and contact the landlord/superintendent for NoK or emergency contacts that may be listed on file.
- Ask the landlord to enter the apartment and look for any documents that might provide information on disposition (Will, funeral pre-arrangements) or other information that may help identify NoK/Claimants, e.g., envelopes/greeting cards, photographs with name/location included, address book, phone bills, banking information, identification, prescription medication providing prescriber name, medical appointment cards, calendar, etc.
- Contact the family physician and ask about documented emergency contacts or NoK.
- Contact Ontario Works/Ontario Disability Support Program (municipal social services) to see if the deceased person was known to be a client and if so, request any documented NoK or emergency contacts.
- Contact the Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee (OPGT) client representative(s) for NoK or potential claimants (see pages 10-14 for specific information about OPGT).
- Contact any NoK or potential claimants identified (see page 8 for Questions to ask).
- Record the full name and contact information for each person/agency you speak with and any information obtained from them related to possible NoK/Claimants on the Claimant Search Worksheet (Appendix D, pages 27-29).

# Disposition Arrangements for Deceased Persons

## Overview
In Ontario, the person who can make disposition arrangements for the deceased person is, in order of priority:
1. Estate Trustee appointed in the will
2. Married or common-law spouse (even if separated)
3. Parents or adult child (equal in rank) (Ward, 2018, p. 18)

## First Degree Relatives
- A key piece of information is knowing if the deceased person has any relatives. This will impact the number of steps required in the NoK/Claimant search and the time to disposition. In many cases, this information will remain unknown requiring all steps in the NoK/Claimant search to be completed. This information is best obtained during life from the patient themselves. It may also be found on a review of the patient file, or from a friend, neighbour, or a co-worker during the NoK/Claimant search.

### Marital Status
- What was the deceased person’s marital status?
- Married
- Common-law (living together for a minimum of 1 year)
- Widowed
- Divorced
- Separated
- Unknown
- Obtain name, address, and contact information of partner.

### Children
- Are there any known adult children of the deceased person?
- Obtain age/date of birth, name, address, and contact information.

### Parents
- Names, location, contact information, alive or pre-deceased, unknown.

### Siblings
- How many siblings?
- Names, location, contact information, alive or pre-deceased, unknown.

## Absence of Next of Kin
In the absence of next of kin, any person (friend, neighbor, co-worker, agency worker) or Agency (Shelter, Church, Government Ministry, Hospice) can claim and make disposition arrangements.

# Police Involvement in NoK/Claimant Search

Requesting involvement of the police is an important step in the NoK/Claimant search. The only exceptions to this step are:

- If the facility is aware from information gathered pre-death that no NoK exists, and/or the deceased person was single and did not have any children; or
- If NoK have been contacted and are unable to claim or do not want to claim (see pages 8-9) and state that there are no other NoK.

At times, an explanation of the request may be required as individual officers may not be familiar with assisting in a NoK/Claimant search on behalf of a facility with an unclaimed deceased person where a coroner is not involved.

## Steps to Request Police Assistance

1. **Contact the police service** in the municipality/region for the address where the deceased person lived.
- In Toronto, enter the address of the deceased person using this website, and it will provide you with the applicable police division: Toronto Police Divisions.

2. **Ask to speak with an officer** in the Criminal Investigations Branch (CIB).

3. **Identify yourself** to the officer and let them know that you are attempting to locate a NoK/Claimant for an unclaimed deceased person at your facility and that you would like to ask that the officer perform a search to assist you.

4. A search will generally include review of the following modalities:
- Police Information Portal
- CPIC
- NICHE
- Social media

5. If the police are reluctant to assist with the request because it is not a criminal matter, please inform them that you have been asked and are required to do this by the Office of the Chief Coroner as part of important steps to identify NoK.

6. The officer may complete the search with you on the phone or they may complete the search and call or email you with results.

7. If you have previously identified the name for next of kin but the phone number is out of service, ask police if they have more current information for this person.

8. If the deceased person lived in a house, ask the police if they will attend the home to search for documents (i.e., will, banking information, etc.).

9. Remember to record the full name, badge number, and contact information for the officer you speak with, as well as the results of the NoK/Claimant search on the Claimant Search Worksheet (Appendix D, pages 27-29).

# Questions to Ask a Contact/Friend/Potential Next of Kin (NoK)

When speaking with a contact of the deceased person, ask the following questions:

- How long have they known the person and are they related?
- Can they provide any information about first-degree relatives that will help complete a family tree?
- Would they like to claim and make arrangements for disposition?
- If not, is there any other next of kin or person who they know of who might want to claim and make arrangements?
- If not, would they like to be notified with the final arrangements?

## Options for Claiming a Deceased Person and Providing Disposition Instructions

1. **Claim the deceased person and fund disposition arrangements out-of-pocket**
- Claimant calls a licensee under the Funeral, Burial and Cremation Services Act, 2002 (FBSCA) (typically a funeral director) of their choice and pays for the service.

2. **Claim the deceased person and seek funding for disposition from the municipal/regional social services where the person lived**
- If the deceased person was a recipient of Ontario Works (OW) or Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP), then the claimant or the funeral service provider can contact OW/ODSP who will facilitate funding.
- If the deceased person was not a recipient of OW/ODSP, then the claimant must visit the municipal/regional social services office where the deceased person lived and present one piece of identification for both the deceased person and the applicant (birth certificate, passport, driver’s license, permanent resident card, citizenship documents, social insurance number, health card). The applicant also needs to provide documentation of the following if in existence:
- Will
- Life Insurance Policy
- Pre-paid funeral arrangements
- Verification of current bank accounts
- Income verification
- Verification of assets (RRSPs, stocks, bonds, investments).
- If the NoK/claimant does not have the appropriate documentation, then they should consider one of the other options.

3. **Claim the deceased person and use the deceased person’s funds for disposition via the bank, or OPGT representative for property if the OPGT was the deceased person’s guardian of property.**
- Where applicable, seek prior approval of the cost from the OPGT.

# Funeral, Burial and Cremation Services Act, 2002 (FBSCA)

## Claimant Process

### 1. Claimant Calls a Licensee
- A claimant contacts a licensee under the Funeral, Burial and Cremation Services Act, 2002 (FBSCA) or a funeral director who will assist with arrangements and provide an invoice for fees.
- The invoice should be sent to the Bank or OPGT representative for property and finance (see OPGT pages 10-14).
- The invoice will be paid from the deceased person’s funds if available.

### 2. Proof of Death
- The Bank may ask for proof of death, i.e., a medical certificate of death (see Medical Certificate of Death page 10).
- Refer to Appendix F for the Proof of Death Letter (page 31).

## Potential Claimant Identified but Does Not Want to Claim or Is Unable to Claim
- Next of Kin (NoK) or other potential claimants are not obligated to make funeral arrangements for the deceased person. There are several reasons for not claiming:
- Fractured family relationships or estrangement
- Inability to fund disposition/funeral arrangements
- Unable to visit the social services office where the death occurred to obtain funding (mobility or transportation issues, distance/travel issues)
- Unable to find or provide pieces of identification required by social services in order to obtain funding

### In This Case:
- Ask if they know of any other potential NoK/Claimants and obtain contact information.
- Ask if they want to be notified of final arrangements.

## What to Do When a Claimant Wants to Claim but Doesn’t Make Arrangements
- When a claimant is identified and indicates they will provide disposition instructions, the facility should follow up with the morgue in one week to ensure that the body has been transferred. Sometimes a claimant indicates their intent to make disposition arrangements, but that may not occur. In cases like this, the facility should:
- Contact the claimant to follow up and determine if and when they will be making disposition arrangements.
- Attempt to identify any barriers and provide suggested approaches:
- Funding – see page 8 options for claiming
- Out-of-country NoK – may require more time—note typically arrangements may be made via email/fax
- Language barrier to understanding – arrange for an interpreter
- Transience/cognition/addiction/mental health challenges – do they need assistance?

----

## Claimant Notification Process

- Have a case worker or agency that can assist?
- Attempt to get the claimant to commit to a timeframe.
- If disposition does not occur in the agreed upon timeframe then send a Claimant Notification Letter (Appendix G, page 32).
- The letter should be sent to the proposed claimant by registered mail or courier so that there is a way to track attempts to deliver/notify and confirm whether the letter was received.
- The letter could be sent by email with use of a delivery and read receipt request.

At the end of the timeframe for claiming outlined in the letter, if the body remains in the morgue then submit the documentation including a copy of the letter to the Office of the Chief Coroner for management of an unclaimed body.

----

## Medical Certificate of Death or Proof of Death

Sometimes claimants may encounter an issue in accessing the deceased person’s funds in order to make funeral arrangements and may be asked for a medical certificate of death. However, the medical certificate of death accompanies the body and may not be copied. NoK/Claimants can obtain a medical certificate of death from the Registrar General’s Office after the funeral arrangements are complete: How to get a copy of Ontario death certificate online.

In lieu of a medical certificate of death, the facility can provide the claimant with a Proof of Death Letter which should adequately address the issue (Appendix F, page 31).

----

## Office of the Public Guardian & Trustee

The Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee (OPGT) delivers a unique and diverse range of services that safeguard the legal, personal, and financial interests of certain private individuals and estates. Operating within the Victims and Vulnerable Persons Division of the Ministry of the Attorney General, the OPGT has almost 400 staff located in six offices throughout Ontario.

OPGT provides a number of services. Clients will have a separate representative for each service being provided. The following services are the most relevant to conducting a reasonable NoK/Claimant search.

# OPGT Responsibilities

## 1. OPGT is Guardian of Property (Finance)
OPGT manages the financial affairs of incapable people who have no one else authorized to do so. The deceased person may have an OPGT client representative for property/finance. In the absence of someone available to claim the body, this representative can make funeral arrangements if:
- a. the deceased person made pre-arrangements
- b. the OPGT is likely to be the Estate Trustee because the criteria listed below in point three are met

The OPGT will not act as Estate Trustee, meaning the client representative for property/finance cannot make funeral arrangements, if the deceased person’s estate is less than $10,000 or will be after the cost of the funeral. However, where funds are available, they can pay an invoice for funeral arrangements from the deceased person’s estate, if a claimant makes arrangements and invoices the estate. The claimant should seek the OPGT representative’s prior approval of the amount where possible.

## 2. OPGT has Made Care and/or Treatment Decisions
OPGT is responsible for making decisions on behalf of incapable people where medical treatment is proposed and there are no other people, such as a relative, who are available, capable, and willing to do so. The OPGT provides a similar service when admission to a long-term care facility is proposed and it is not possible to obtain informed consent from another authorized person, such as a relative. The role of this representative ends upon the death of the patient and does not include making funeral arrangements. However, the OPGT treatment decisions consultant may be aware of NoK and/or possible claimants.

## 3. OPGT is Estate Trustee
OPGT protects the interests of potential heirs when an Ontario resident dies leaving an estate and there is no one who can administer it. As Estate Trustee, the OPGT will make funeral arrangements.

The OPGT will apply to be appointed Estate Trustee if:
1. the deceased was an Ontario resident or owned real estate here; and
2. the deceased did not make a will or the deceased did make a will but the executor has since died or become incapable; and
3. there are no known next-of-kin living in Ontario or the next-of-kin are minors or mentally incapable adults; and

# OPGT Estate Management Guidelines

## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this document is to outline the procedures for managing estates under the Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee (OPGT).

## 2. Estate Valuation
- The estate is valued at a minimum of **$10,000.00** after payment of the funeral and all debts owing by the estate.

## 3. Contacting the OPGT during a NoK/Claimant Search
- If it is known that the deceased person had an OPGT representative for care and/or treatment decisions and/or an OPGT representative for property/finance, then contact each representative directly and ask about potential NoK/claimants.
- If it is not known whether or not the deceased person had an OPGT representative or the name and contact information for the representative is not available, then contact the Treatment Decisions Unit Team Leader via the main intake line **416-327-6683** for any information on potential NoK/Claimants.
- If a NoK/Claimant is identified, OPGT Estates will work with the person to support disposition/funeral planning (See Decision Tree, Appendix B, page 24).
- If the deceased person has an OPGT client representative for property/finance:
- When contacting the representative:
- If there are no NoK/claimants, then ask if OPGT will make funeral arrangements (OPGT will do this when there are pre-arrangements or where the OPGT will likely become the Estate Trustee).
- If the deceased person has an OPGT client representative for property/finance, then a referral to OPGT Estates is not necessary.
- If the deceased person does not have an OPGT client representative for property/finance and/or no NoK/Claimants were identified by the OPGT treatment decisions consultant, then it is necessary for the facility to make a referral to OPGT Estates. OPGT has unique legislative powers to gather information in order to determine whether to administer an Estate, which may include names and contact information for beneficiaries or NoK.
- An OPGT Estates referral is required by the Office of the Chief Coroner in all cases when a body remains unclaimed, including situations when deceased persons were homeless or living in apparent poverty. The only exceptions are:
- When the deceased person already has an OPGT client representative.

## 4. Conclusion
These guidelines are intended to ensure that the management of estates is conducted in a consistent and efficient manner, adhering to the legislative requirements and best practices.

# OPGT Estates Referral Process

## Making an OPGT Estates Referral

1. **Complete the Crown Estate Report Template**
- Refer to **Appendix E, page 30**.
- Attach the completed template in an email along with a summary of the search thus far (contacts found, results of attempts to contact).

2. **Email OPGTEstatesAdmin@ontario.ca** with the following message:
- Hello, I would like to launch an investigation into the estate of **<name of deceased person>**. **<name of deceased>** died on **<date>** and is thus far unclaimed. Thank you, **<name of staff/contact information>**.

3. **Response from OPGT**
- OPGT should reply within **two business days** with the name and contact information of the Estates Officer and a file number for the deceased person.

4. **Follow-Up**
- Mark your calendar for **4 weeks** from the date of the reply. If you have not heard back from the Estates Officer by that date, send a follow-up email referring to the file number assigned to the deceased person’s case with the following message:
- Hello, I am following up on the investigation into the estate of **<deceased person’s name>** which was launched on **<date>**. Can you please provide an update? Thank you, **<name of staff/contact information>**.

5. **Investigation Timeline**
- Please note that an OPGT Estates investigation can take a minimum of **4 weeks**. If the deceased person has assets, the investigation will likely take longer, sometimes months. During this time, the facility remains responsible for storing the deceased person’s body.
- If the OPGT Estates investigation is ongoing after **8 weeks**, the facility can ask the Estates Officer if they have enough financial information to move forward with funeral arrangements or fund storage of the deceased person’s body.
- If the OPGT Estates Officer is unable to move forward with funeral arrangements after **8 weeks**, the facility can submit the NoK search documentation (see page 14) to the **Regional Supervising Coroner’s Office (RSCO)** for your area (see page).

# Document Title

## Section 1: Introduction
- Overview of the process for handling unclaimed bodies.

## Section 2: Responsibilities of the RSCO
- The RSCO can contact the Estates Officer to see if the NoK aspect of the investigation is complete.
- If it is and there are no NoK/claimants, then the RSCO can issue a warrant for a municipal burial.
- Both the facility and the municipality can work with the OPGT Estates Officer to recoup the costs of storage and funeral arrangements from the estate when the investigation is completed.

## Section 3: Role of the OPGT Estates Officer
- The OPGT Estates Officer will inform you when the investigation is complete whether or not they will be administering the estate.
- If they are not administering the estate, they will say that the individual does not qualify for representation.
- If they are going to administer the estate, then they will make funeral arrangements for the deceased person.
- During the initial stages of the estate investigation, the OPGT will conduct some basic, quick searches for NoK so that a decision may be made and disposition arranged in a timely manner.
- If the OPGT Estates Officer identifies NoK/possible claimants, the OPGT will disclose this information to the Office of the Chief Coroner only and not to facility staff conducting the NoK/Claimant search.
- If they are aware of a NoK, they will let you know this, and you should contact the RSCO for your area (pages 16-17) who will reach out to the OPGT and obtain the NoK information and share that with you.
- Record the results of the OPGT Estate investigation on the Claimant Search Worksheet (Appendix D, pages 27-29).

## Section 4: Submitting NoK/Claimant Search Documentation
- Once the NoK/Claimant search is complete and no claimant has been identified, then fax or email all relevant documentation in one package to the Regional Supervising Coroner’s Office for the county/municipality where the death occurred (pages 16-17).
- Please wait until you have finished the complete search before submission; i.e., do not submit individual aspects of the NoK/Claimant search as they are completed because our offices are unable to track pieces of information pertaining to an unclaimed body at a facility.
- Incomplete submissions will be returned to the facility/staff person to complete, which can cause unnecessary delays in disposition.

## MEMORANDUM

**C17-75**

**TO:** ALL HOSPITAL CEOs
**FROM:** Dr. Dirk Huyer, Chief Coroner for Ontario
**DATE:** Thursday March 30, 2017
**RE:** Unclaimed Bodies

This correspondence is to provide notification of the process that the Office of the Chief Coroner will be following when informed about a potential unclaimed body as defined in the Anatomy Act that does not fall under the jurisdiction of a coroner (i.e. the natural or expected death of a patient/resident).

Prior to a Regional Supervising Coroner providing disposition instructions to the local municipality for burial, your facility will be responsible for undertaking reasonable efforts to locate a Next of Kin (NOK) or claimant alternative.

- A claimant may be anyone who wants to claim the body for burial or cremation;
- A claimant may not necessarily be required to take financial responsibility for the funeral, burial or cremation.

Until recently, administrative staff for the Regional Supervising Coroner has often been completing a NOK/Claimant search relating to unclaimed bodies in facilities such as hospitals and long term care homes. Going forward, the responsibility for a NOK/Claimant search will rest with the facility where the decedent died.

As it is important to facilitate timely and dignified disposition of deceased persons, some facilities have a social worker(s) who assumes responsibility for finding a NOK/Claimant. When a NOK/Claimant search is not made a priority, the condition of the body may deteriorate in a morgue over weeks to months.

# Body Storage and Transfer of Decedents

## Responsibility of the Facility
Body storage/transfer of the decedent and the associated fees will be the responsibility of your facility. The Office of the Chief Coroner and Regional Offices do not have the capacity to provide storage.

## Information Collection
Ideally, your facility should collect information about your patients/residents and their next of kin upon admission to your facility. This practice will reduce the amount of work and potential costs to your facility if/when a patient/resident dies in your facility.

## Tools Provided by the Regional Supervising Coroner
To assist your facility staff with their search for a Next of Kin (NOK)/Claimant, the Regional Supervising Coroner offices will provide the following tools:

1. **Next of Kin/Claimant Search Form**
- This form must be completed before disposition instructions will be provided by the Regional Supervising Coroner’s office—completion of this is the responsibility of your organization.

2. **Decision Tree for Unclaimed Bodies**
- The Decision Tree will assist you in your attempt to find a NOK/Claimant.
- Steps 1-3 of the Decision Tree demonstrate the expected reasonable effort made to find a NOK/Claimant.

3. **List of Key Items or Documents**
- These items or documents will help you find a potential NOK/Claimant.

## Note
The Regional Supervising Coroner’s office will not be conducting NOK/Claimant searches on your behalf, but can act as a resource to your facility staff to assist with questions pertaining to a NOK/Claimant search.

Sincerely,
Dirk Huyer, MD
Chief Coroner for Ontario

## MEMORANDUM
**C17-75**

**TO:** ALL LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES
**FROM:** Dirk Huyer, Chief Coroner for Ontario
**DATE:** June 14, 2017
**RE:** Unclaimed Bodies

This correspondence is to provide notification of the process that the Office of the Chief Coroner will be following when informed about a potential unclaimed body as defined in the Anatomy Act that does not fall under the jurisdiction of a coroner (i.e. the natural or expected death of a patient/resident).

### Pursuant to Section 3 of the Anatomy Act:
> .. the person having possession of the body of a deceased person that,
> (a) is unclaimed by a relative or friend within twenty-four hours after the death; and
> (b) has not been or will not be used for a purpose authorized under the Human Tissue Gift Act,
> shall notify the local inspector and shall furnish the local inspector with such information respecting the deceased person as is within the knowledge of the notifier and as the local inspector may require. R.S.O. 1990, c. A.21, s. 3 (1); 2016, c. 23, s. 35.

Prior to a Regional Supervising Coroner providing disposition instructions to the local municipality for burial, your facility will be responsible for undertaking reasonable efforts to locate a Next of Kin (NOK) or claimant alternative. A claimant may be anyone who wants to claim the body for burial or cremation.

# Next of Kin/Claimant Search Guidelines

## Overview
A claimant may not necessarily be required to take financial responsibility for the funeral, burial, or cremation.

## Responsibility for NOK/Claimant Search
Until recently, administrative staff for the Regional Supervising Coroner have often been completing a NOK/Claimant search relating to unclaimed bodies in facilities such as hospitals and long-term care homes. Going forward, the responsibility for a NOK/Claimant search will rest with the facility where the decedent died.

### Importance of Timely Disposition
As it is important to facilitate timely and dignified disposition of deceased persons, some facilities have a designated staff person, such as a social worker, who assumes responsibility for finding a NOK/Claimant. When a NOK/Claimant search is not made a priority, the condition of the body may deteriorate in a morgue over weeks to months.

## Body Storage and Transfer
Body storage/transfer of the decedent and the associated fees will be the responsibility of your facility. The Office of the Chief Coroner and Regional Offices do not have the capacity to provide storage.

### Maintaining Up-to-Date Information
Ideally, your facility should collect and maintain up-to-date information about your patients/residents and their next of kin upon admission to your facility. This practice will reduce the amount of work and potential costs to your facility if/when a patient/resident dies in your facility.

## Tools for NOK/Claimant Search
To assist your facility staff with their search for a NOK/Claimant, the following tools are enclosed:

1. **Next of Kin/Claimant Search Form**
- This form must be completed before disposition instructions will be provided by the Regional Supervising Coroner’s office—completion of this is the responsibility of your organization.

2. **Decision Tree for Unclaimed Bodies**
- The Decision Tree will assist you in your attempt to find a NOK/Claimant.
- Steps 1-3 of the Decision Tree demonstrate the expected reasonable efforts made to find a NOK/Claimant.

# Appendix G – Claimant Notification Letter

<Facility Letterhead>
<DATE>
<Addressee (NoK/Claimant)>
<Re: Name of Deceased Person:>

Dear NoK/Claimant,

I am writing from <Name of Facility> seeking next steps regarding burial or cremation for <Name of Deceased Person>. The request put forth relates to your late <(father/mother/brother/sister etc)>. On behalf of the <Name of Facility>, please accept our sincere condolences.

Unfortunately, our previous contact with you has not led to any specific plan with regard to your <(father/mother/brother/sister’s)> funeral arrangements.

- <Describe attempts to contact or actual contact and dates i.e. Our office has tried to contact you (by phone/email) several times (list dates) without success and have not been able to leave a message.>

Therefore, I am writing to ask that you make arrangements with a funeral home to have your late <(father/mother/brother/sister etc)> transferred from the <Facility Name> Hospital before <Date (14 days from date couriered)>.

Should <(name of deceased person)> still remain in the <Facility Name> on <Date (10-14 days from date couriered)>, then we will ask the Office of the Chief Coroner of Ontario to direct the Municipal Corporation of <(City)> to bury <(name of decedent)> under the authority of Section 11 of the Anatomy Act.

Sincerely,
<Facility staff representative>
