Person-centred care is an approach that respects the unique values, history, culture, and preferences of individuals, promoting dignity, collaboration, and quality of life in care. Person-centred care focuses on residents’ strengths, capabilities, preferences, and priorities and is adapted to their varying cognitive abilities and communication styles.### What is dementia? Dementia is a syndrome characterized by a decline in cognitive function that interferes with a person’s ability to perform everyday activities. It is caused by various diseases or injuries that affect the brain.### What are responsive behaviours? Responsive behaviours refer to actions, words, or gestures that may arise as expressions of unmet needs, discomfort, or distress. These behaviours are often a response to the person’s environment, interactions, or underlying medical or psychological conditions.### What might we see with responsive behaviours? - **Physical and verbal agitation/restlessness:** Can stem from physical discomfort, emotional distress, or environmental triggers.",

Engage:\n- Speak in a calm, reassuring tone. - Use familiar phrases and validate feelings.## 3. Redirect:\n- Offer an enjoyable or soothing activity (e.g., a favourite song). - Offer conversation that engages the resident to redirect attention to something else.## 4. Adjust Environment:\n- Reduce stimuli and provide comfort. - Reduce loud noises, bright lights, or other environmental stressors.# Non-Pharmacological InterventionsNon-drug approaches can often effectively manage responsive behaviours:## 1. Music and Art Therapy:\n- Music linked to personal memories can reduce agitation and increase engagement. - Calming and engaging.## 2. Sensory Stimulation:\n- Gentle touch, aromatherapy (where appropriate), or soothing visuals can offer comfort.## 3.",

For example, the guiding questions prompt analysis for:- What was happening before the behaviour, including triggers and environmental factors. - A description of the observed behaviour. - What is happening immediately after the behaviour, including how staff respond and what the resident does next.## Key Takeaways\n- Responsive behaviours are a form of communication. - Effective communication and de-escalation are essential. - Collaborate with the care team and continuously adapt strategies. - Management requires a holistic, person-centred approach.# References\n- Canadian Clinical Practice Guidelines for Assessing & Managing Behavioural & Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) (2024).",
