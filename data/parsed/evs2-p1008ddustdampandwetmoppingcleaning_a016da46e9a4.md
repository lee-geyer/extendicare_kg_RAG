### Dust Mopping
Starting at the furthest corner of the room, dust mop in the direction of the door, paying particular attention to corners, under beds, and under heating units. Avoid shaking and lifting the mop during mopping motions.

1. Pick up accumulated dust with a dustpan and whisk broom at the doorway. Do not leave dust in a pile at the doorway.
2. Empty contents of the dustpan into the garbage on the housekeeping cart.
3. If using microfiber dusting pads, change the pad as instructed; otherwise, change dry mop heads at least 3 times per shift or when visibly soiled.

### Damp Mopping
1. Prepare cleaning solution according to the manufacturer’s instructions using proper personal protective equipment (PPE) according to Safety Data Sheet (SDS).
2. Place wet floor signs in the appropriate area. In traffic areas (corridors), only damp mop half the area at a time. Ensure the floor has been dust mopped first.
3. Place mop in cleaning solution.
4. Wring out until the mop is damp.
5. Move mop lengthwise along the baseboard. Use a “figure 8” motion on the balance of the area (open areas).
6. Turn mop often and rinse mop frequently.
7. Use the heel of the mop (with scrubbing pad) to remove stubborn spots.

a. When the area is dry, remove wet floor signs and replace furniture and equipment.
**Note:** Damp mopping should not leave excess amounts of water on the floor. The area should be dry in approximately 10 minutes.
b. Cleaning solution will be changed every 3-4 rooms, when visibly soiled, or if in contact with contaminated soils, i.e., urine, feces, or other bodily fluids.
c. Send soiled mop heads for laundering at the end of the shift.

### Wet Mopping
1. Work from clean areas to dirty areas.
2. Prepare cleaning solution according to the manufacturer’s instructions using proper personal protective equipment (PPE) according to SDS.
3. Place mop in cleaning solution.
4. Wring out mop slightly.
5. Move mop lengthwise along the baseboard. Use a “figure 8” motion on the balance area. Be careful not to splash water on walls and clean the baseboards as you go.
6. Turn mop often and rinse as required.
7. Only mop an area size that is safe for you to reach without walking on the area being cleaned.
8. Use the heel of the mop (with scrub pad) for removing stubborn spots.
9. Remove excess water from the floor.
10. Wring and repeat the procedure until the entire area is covered.
11. When the area is dry, remove wet floor signs and replace furniture and equipment.
12. Send soiled mop heads for laundering at the end of the shift.

### Wet Mopping Using Microfibre
Work from clean areas to dirty.
