## How to Enter a Lab Result

1. Open HealthConnex and click on “lab results” on the left-hand side of the screen.
2. Scroll down to near the middle of the screen and click “+ New lab result”.
- Fill in the boxes marked with a red *:
- **Individual** – type resident's name and select.
- **Collection date** – enter the date the specimen is collected.
- **Culture date** – use the date of specimen collection, update when results are received.
- **Procedure** – rapid tests are “POC device”, PCR swabs are “Respiratory culture”.
- **Result** – for rapid test results use “preliminary positive” or “preliminary negative”. All other specimens will be “pending” until lab report is received.
- **Organism** – leave blank until a lab report is received, and an organism is identified.
- **Source** – rapid tests enter as “shallow anterior nasal swab”, PCR tests enter as “nasopharynx”. For other specimen collections, please select the most accurate option.
- **Reason** – select as appropriate.
- **Lab ID** – select the box beside “use auto-generated lab id”.
3. Click “add” to save.
4. Once the lab report is received, please update the “culture date” with the date on the lab report and the organism that is identified.

## Notes:
- If you are collecting multiple of one type of swab (rapid tests/PCR tests), these can be entered using “Batch lab entry” and multiple residents can be selected at a time.
- Don’t enter externally obtained lab specimens, only specimens collected at the home.
- If more than one organism is identified on a specimen, add a second organism using New Lab Result.
