Consent must be informed, voluntary, and given by the resident the information is about.There are two types of consent - express consent and implied consent:\n- **a.** Express consent can be provided verbally, in writing, or electronically, and can be withdrawn at any time by the resident. Ensure all verbal express consents are recorded as part of the resident’s record. - **b.** HCPs can assume a resident’s implied consent to use and disclose their PHI within the resident’s circle of care and only as long as that information will be used to provide health care or services to that resident.Express consent is required for the disclosure of PHI to a person or organization that is not another HCP, or for purposes other than providing health services.#### Consent on Behalf of Incapable or Deceased Residents\nIf a resident is deemed incapable of providing, withholding, or withdrawing their consent, their substitute decision maker (SDM) may make a decision about the resident’s PHI on their behalf.",
