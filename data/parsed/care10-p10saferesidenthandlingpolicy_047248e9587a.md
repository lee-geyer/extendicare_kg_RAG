## POLICY

Extendicare is committed to ensuring the safety of all residents and staff related to transfer and lift activities, the use of appropriate devices, and proper body mechanics through associated procedures and education.

## STANDARD

Protocols for safe resident handling are established through consultation with Health and Safety and Restorative committees to minimize risk of injury, maintain resident dignity, and promote optimal independence in daily living.

- A Safe Resident Handling Lead, who is a nurse in the home, collaborates with the interdisciplinary team and oversees the program, including coordinating and/or facilitating education to ensure safe resident handling practices and competencies are maintained in the home.
- An ongoing assessment of residents’ functional and cognitive abilities to inform safe lifts and transfers, including the potential need for the use of mechanical lifts and/or other devices, will be conducted for the development of an individualized plan of care.
- The dignity, safety, and comfort of all residents will be maintained through any necessary consideration or adaptation where it is possible to meet individualized needs, including procurement of specialized transfer and lift equipment where applicable (i.e., bariatric).
- Any refusals or concerns related to resident handling by the resident/SDM will be managed by the Director of Care, and a review of alternative equipment solutions or methods for care will be determined.
- Transfer logos will be utilized to depict the residents’ lift and transfer status to support provincial and health authorities’ regulatory requirements for the enhanced safety of both resident and staff and continuity of care.
- All assistive devices, including mechanical lifts and slings, will be utilized and maintained according to manufacturer’s/vendor instructions.
- All staff providing assistance with resident lifts and transfers will receive education, including an annual demonstration of competency with lifts, transfers, repositioning, and proper body mechanics in conjunction with Extendicare’s policies and procedures.
- Extendicare’s No Manual Lift Mandate requires the use of a mechanical lift and/or transfer device to assist any resident who:
- Is non-weight bearing.
- Exhibits high risk factors as per a safe lift and transfer risk assessment.
