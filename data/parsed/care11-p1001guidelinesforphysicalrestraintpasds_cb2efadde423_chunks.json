Sleep Observation for Bed Rail Use to monitor resident sleep patterns to determine whether bed rails can safely be utilized. - The nurse will review and document outcomes from the 72hr. Sleep Observation for Bed Rail Use on the Restraint/PASD Assessment and Evaluation, where additional elements will be assessed, including the resident’s physical size, mobility status, history of falls from bed, and any cognitive and/or communication deficits.",
