## Maintenance Program Documentation

### PROCEDURE

- Whenever maintenance is performed on a piece of equipment, ensure that:
- The maintenance record is updated to show that the work was done;
- A list is made of any major components replaced;
- A record is made of any future work that may be required.

- The record should also be dated and signed or initialed since it may become a legal document if it is produced to demonstrate compliance with legislated maintenance requirements.

- Since these records may become legal documents, they should be retained for at least 7 years. Some documents which record the history of individual pieces of equipment and the major repairs to it should be retained until the equipment is replaced or otherwise permanently decommissioned from service.

- Some inspections and reports are required by code or regulations. Often these reports and inspections are performed as required by certified service firms and the Maintenance Department is required to keep copies to demonstrate that the work was done.

- Some of these inspections and reports are carried out and prepared by qualified outside agencies (such as licensed contractors or skilled tradesmen) and some are carried out and prepared by facility maintenance staff.

#### Examples of these types of forms are listed below:

1. **Externally Generated Documents:**
- Fire Alarm System Inspections/Fire Protection Equipment Inspections
- Sprinkler System Inspections
- Electricity Generator Inspections
- Building Heating and Ventilation System Inspections
- Back-flow Prevention Equipment Inspections
- Elevator Inspections
- Mechanical Lift Inspection Reports
- Hazardous Material Surveys (such as asbestos reports).

2. **Internally Generated Documents:**
- Daily Log
- Kitchen/Laundry Water Temperature Log
- Building Maintenance Checklists
- Building Equipment Checklists

- These documents should be collected by the maintenance staff and stored in a manner that makes them easily accessible and easy to present to the government and other inspectors.

- One way to do this is to create a binder for each year and store all the documents for that year in the binder, with tabs to divide the binder and make the documents easy to find. These records should be retained for at least 3 years to provide a history of the maintenance.
- Documents that help in organizing work may be the most useful to maintenance staff, since by helping to organize work they can make the job less stressful. Some of these documents are also listed as documents required for compliance and for providing a history, since they not only help organize work but also record what has been done.
- Monthly Maintenance Calendar
- Annual Maintenance Calendar
- Building Maintenance Checklist
- Building Equipment Checklist
- Maintenance Request Log
- Daily Log
- List of budget items for future consideration
- Valve Location Chart
- Following are examples of documents that provide a history of repairs that have been done to the building or equipment, contractors who have been involved in work, warranty information for equipment, etc. which may include the following:
- Equipment Record Form (located in “Equipment Inventory and Records”)
- Service Firm Log
- Building Maintenance Checklist
- Building Equipment Checklist (located in “Preventative Maintenance”)
- Tool Inventory List
- The Maintenance Department is an important part of a larger organization. It is important that maintenance staff stay in contact with the remainder of the organization, and that is done often using specific documents and forms. Samples of some of these forms include:
- Maintenance Request Log
- Monthly Maintenance Report and Repair Cost Summary
- List of budget items for future consideration.
