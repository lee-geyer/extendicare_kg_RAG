      "text": "# How to Wear a Face Mask the Safe and Smart Way!## The Right Way\n- Make sure your mask completely covers your nose and mouth and is secured snugly under your chin.\n- Wash your hands before you put on, and after you take off, your mask.\n- Touch only the ties or ear loops when putting on or taking off your mask.\n- If your mask has a metal wire running along the top edge, mold it over the bridge of your nose to help contain droplets.\n- Dispose of the mask when it becomes damaged, soiled, or contaminated with body fluids (droplets/secretions).\n- Store masks in a clean environment.## The Wrong Way\n- Don’t touch the outside of your mask while you are wearing it.\n- Don’t lower your mask so you can talk.\n- Don’t wear a mask that’s too loose or slides down your face.\n- Don’t rest your mask around your neck or under your chin.\n- Don’t hang your mask off your ear.\n- Don’t double-mask (wear one mask on top of another).> When worn properly, a mask is an important way to prevent the spread of infection.",
