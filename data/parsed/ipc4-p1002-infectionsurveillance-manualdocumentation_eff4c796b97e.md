# PROCEDURE

## SECTION: Infection
### DESCRIPTION: Infection Surveillance
### INDEX: IPC4-P10.02

- Review 24-Hour Symptom Surveillance Form at the beginning of each shift and observe for any sign of pattern of symptoms suggesting an infection or potential outbreak and ensuring data completion for accuracy.
- Review the Resident health record for any signs or pattern of symptoms suggesting an infection or potential outbreak.
- Ensure the appropriate transmission-based precautions are implemented immediately should any signs of pattern of symptoms suggest an infection or potential outbreak.
- Analyze and interpret the data collected to establish baselines and trends.

Infection trends that may be detected include:
- Types and rates of infections
- Areas within the Home that may be experiencing a rise in the baseline number of Residents with a certain type of infection.
- Infections caused by a similar microorganism.
- Infections that have occurred in a similar timeframe or associated with certain procedures or equipment.
- Decreases in the number of cases of a particular type of infection may be due to the infection prevention and control modifications put into place.

The Analysis shall be done as frequently as necessary, but at least monthly, using the Monthly Infection Surveillance Form data, to intervene as appropriate (e.g., interview employees, provide education, review policies, perform appropriate audits, and communicate to appropriate stakeholders and employees).

- Use the analysis from the Monthly Infection Surveillance Form to complete the Monthly Infection Electronic Workbook to identify education and training needs.
- Total the number of infections by category and review infection rates monthly.
- Compare the current month’s statistics to the previous two (2) months’ statistics as well as the same month of the previous year. If there is a significant difference in infection rates, develop an action plan to address the findings. Actions in the plan must include a process for investigation, education, and ongoing monitoring of infection rates.
- Present monthly infection statistics with any required action plan(s) to the Infection Prevention and Control (IPAC) Committee and/or the Medical/Professional Advisory Committee.
- Upload the completed Monthly Infection Electronic Workbook quarterly to the OneDrive folder.

The Homes senior management (Executive Director/Administrator, Director Of Care, Director of Health and Wellness) in collaboration with the Infection Control Professional/designate will ensure infection control rates and reports are communicated to the employees.

- Targeted surveillance may be implemented in addition to total surveillance. It may include:
- Specific types of infections, such as urinary tract or those caused by a particular organism.
