# Intended Audience & Training

## Who is this training for and what other training is required

- All staff taking part in resident Skin & Wound Care
- Role Specific Education (e.g., nurse)
- Vendor/Product Specific Education

# Learning Objectives

## What You’ll Learn in This Session
- **Recall the Policy and Procedures for Prevention and Management of Skin & Wound**
- **Define skin integrity and wound types**
- **Identify staff and leadership roles in skin and wound care**
- **Describe quality improvement practices**

# Understanding Skin Integrity & Wound Types

## Why Healthy Skin Matters

Skin integrity refers to intact, healthy skin that serves as a barrier against harm.

### Common Wound Types Include:
- **Pressure Injuries**
- Stages 1-4
- Unstageable
- Deep Tissue Injury – DTI
- **Skin Tears**
- **Bruises**
- **Abrasion**
- **Moisture-Associated Skin Damages (MASD)**
- **Injuries caused by friction and shear**

# Pressure Injuries & PURS Overview

## Identifying and Preventing Pressure-Related Injuries

PURS (Pressure Ulcer Risk Scale) helps assess risk and guide preventive actions.

### Pressure Ulcer Stages:
| Stage | Description                          |
|-------|--------------------------------------|
| 1     | Redness, no open wound               |
| 2     | Shallow open ulcer                   |
| 3     | Full-thickness skin loss             |
| 4     | Extensive tissue loss                |
| Unstageable / DTI | Obscured or deep damage |

Pressure injuries result from unrelieved pressure, usually over bony areas.

### High-risk sites:
- Sacrum
- Heels
- Elbows
- Hips

Frequent repositioning and risk assessments help reduce occurrence.

# Common Skin Risks & Prevention Strategies

## Managing Friction, Shear, Moisture & Skin Tears

| **Friction**                     | **Shear**                          | **Moisture**                       | **Skin Tears**                     |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Rubbing of skin against surfaces  | Deeper injury from skin layers     | Exposure to urine, feces, sweat,  | Traumatic wounds common in older   |
| (e.g., linens or equipment)      | sliding in opposite directions,     | or wound drainage that weakens     | adults with fragile skin            |
| causing superficial damage        | often from improper repositioning   | skin (MASD risk)                  |                                    |

### Prevention Strategies:
- Gentle repositioning and proper transfer techniques
- Keep skin clean, dry, and moisturized
- Use barrier creams and absorbent products
- Dress residents in soft clothing and long sleeves
- Perform regular skin assessments
