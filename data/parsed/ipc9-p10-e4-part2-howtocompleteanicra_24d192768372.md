# Background

- A systematic tool that is used to assess the risk and the level of Preventive Measures (or IPAC Measures) needed
- Found in policy tools
- To be completed for all construction, renovation and maintenance (CRM) activities, which are commonly referred to as “construction activities”
- ICRA considers two factors when assessing risk:
- The population at risk
- The level of construction activities
- Based on these factors, the ICRA helps determine the level of Preventive Measures

## Background – Cont.

- The ICRA is to be completed by the Interdisciplinary Team (IDT).
- Must be communicated to the project supervisor and signed by them.
- Must also be communicated to all staff, including care staff, maintenance staff, managers, and others in the home.
- The contractor and their staff must be educated on the preventive measures and how to behave in the home (e.g., not going into resident areas, hand hygiene, mask use, adhering to all protocols, etc.).

### Construction (check all that apply)
- New Phase
- Renovation Phase
- Maintenance Phase
- Phase 5
- No Phases

**Full description of work to be done** (the scope of work can also be attached to this ICRA):
- Select Phases only if your project will be completed in phases (otherwise select “No Phases”). Each phase should have its own ICRA.
- Most projects are not large enough to be completed in multiple phases and will only require 1 ICRA (i.e., No Phases).
- The Scope of Work should capture, at minimum, in detail:
- The work that will be executed
- How long each portion of the work will take
- The amount of dust expected to be generated
- Other information as necessary

|         | Public areas that are far from resident care areas    | Housekeeping rooms and closets if far from resident care areas |
|         | Maintenance rooms, if far from the resident care areas| Loading dock                                          |
| Group 2 | Activity rooms if far from resident care areas        | Hair salon, if far from resident care areas           |
| Medium  | Common areas and reception areas, if far from resident care areas | Occupational therapy and physical therapy areas if far from resident care areas |
| Group 3 | Resident rooms and hallways                           | Food preparation serving and dining areas             |
| Medium  | Nurse's station                                       | Clean linen handling and storage area                 |
| High    | Activity rooms, physical therapy rooms and other care areas that are near the resident areas | Medication room                                       |
|         | Spa/shower room                                       |                                                       |
| Group   | Designated dental procedure rooms (where available)   |                                                       |
| Highest |                                                       |                                                       |

- Determine the population at risk, which will be affected by the construction work.
- In most cases, it will be Group 3 (because LTC homes house vulnerable residents).
- Lower Risk Groups can be selected assuming that the area where the construction is taking place is far from resident care areas.
- It is not acceptable to assign a lower risk group if the residents will be present near the construction zone.

## Step 3: Preventative Measures Matrix

### Population Risk Group (Circle One)
Refer to Step 1.
- Highlight/select the Population Risk Group and
- Construction Activity Type (Circle One)
Refer to Step 2
- Construction/Renovation Type that you have previously evaluated
- Then determine the level of Preventive Measures needed based on the Preventive Measures Matrix
- The matrix takes into consideration the size of the work to be done and the population that could be affected by such work

**Important:** *You must reach out to your IPAC Consultant if either Preventive Measures III or IV will be implemented to ensure that all the required measures are in place*

### Population Risk Group and Construction/Renovation Activity Type

| Population Risk Group | Type A | Type B | Type C | Type D |
|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Group 1               |        |        |        |        |
| Group 2               |        | III*   | IV*    |        |

# Step 3: Preventive Measures Matrix

- Ensure that you identify the risk group in areas that will be affected by the construction work
- This includes adjacent units that are above, below, to the right, and to the left
- Based on that, you will determine the final preventive measures required using the matrix

| Unit Below | Unit Above | Lateral Left | Lateral Right | Behind | Front | Risk Group |
|------------|------------|--------------|---------------|--------|-------|------------|
|            |            |              |               |        |       |            |

# Preventive Measures

- Split into 4 categories:
- **Preventive Measures I** – Least strict
- **Preventive Measures II** – Strict
- **Preventive Measures III** – Stricter
- **Preventive Measures IV** – Strictest
- The riskier the construction work, the higher the category.
- If a higher level of Preventive Measures is selected, then all the measures in this level plus the measures in the lower levels must be followed:
- For example, if the IDT decides that Preventive Measures III are needed, then Preventive Measures I, II, and III will be implemented (not just III).
```

```markdown
# Preventive Measures I

- Most important initial step for all the projects: Communicate the preventive measures needed to the contractor/maintenance. Clear communication of expectations is important!
- Educate staff on the preventive measures that will be implemented.
- Complete a brief clean of the area first (to minimize initial contamination).
- Identify all residents that will be affected and move them away from the work zone. You must never allow residents to be present near the work area, no matter how small the work will be!
- Protect resident care equipment and furniture (e.g., by covering them).
- Minimize the amount of dust generated (e.g., immediately disinfect the work area with a disinfectant, wet mop the area but do not sweep).
```

```markdown
# Preventive Measures II

In addition to Preventive Measures I:

- Determine traffic route for constructors and limit their movement within the home (avoid main entrance, common areas, resident care areas, choose the closest entrance/exit to the construction area, dedicate a stairwell, etc.)
- Determine a safe route for transport of clean and sterile supplies (e.g., clean linen and medication) that avoids the construction zone
- Prevent airborne dust from dispersing (e.g., HEPA vacuuming at the point of drilling or sanding to capture dust, use drop sheets, etc.)
- Seal unused doors adjacent to the construction area; you can use construction tape
- Seal all air intakes & sources of air leak (e.g., plugs, drains, chutes, plumbing)
- HEPA vacuum and disinfect the work surfaces after each task, and upon completion of all work
- Contain dust tightly before transport (e.g., double bagging or tightly covered containers)
- Place walk-off mat (Sticky mat) at entrance/exit of work area
- Workers must HEPA vacuum their clothes and boots. No tracking of dust in the home!!
```

```markdown
# Sealing All Sources of Air Leak in the Work Area

- This can be done by using poly sheet + construction tape (e.g., air vents)
- This can also be done by using construction tape only (e.g., plugs and drains)
- Sources of air leak **MUST NOT** be left exposed, no matter how small
- Sealing the doors of unused areas will prevent dust from penetrating adjacent areas
```

```markdown
# Mulsebac 1000 HEPA Vacuums

- **HEPA vacuums** are a special type of vacuum cleaners that are equipped with HEPA filters.
- A HEPA vacuum is meant to filter at least **99.97%** of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria, and any airborne particles with a size of **0.3 microns (μm)**.
- HEPA vacuums are rigorously tested and leak tested.
- **Regular vacuums MUST NOT** be used as they will disperse infectious particles and dust even further.
```

# Sticky/Walk Off Mats

- Walk off mats are meant to trap dust from boots.
- They are to be placed at **ALL** entrances/exits to the construction area.
- The mats can be fiber mats or sticky mats; both serve the same purpose.
- Fiber walk off mats must be **HEPA** vacuumed daily and when visibly soiled.
- The outer layer of a sticky mat can be peeled off to expose a new, clean layer.

```markdown
# Preventive Measures III

In addition to Preventive Measures I & II:

- Debris build up is minimized in the work area. All debris is removed at the end of each workday, at minimum (tightly covered containers).
- Erect dust barriers around the construction zone, from the floor to the underside of the deck (including the areas above false ceilings) consisting of two layers of 0.15 mm (6 mil) fire-retardant poly plastic sheets.
- Maintain negative air pressure (minimum 7.5 Pa/0.03" WC) within work site utilizing HEPA-equipped Construction Air Handling Units (CAHU).
- Do not use the home’s HVAC system to exhaust construction air.
- Do not exhaust the air inside the home, near any air intakes, or outdoors where residents would be present (e.g., courtyard). Even if the air is HEPA-filtered, it still poses a big risk.

> **Note:** If there are no other solutions, reach out to your IPAC Consultant.
```

# Preventive Measures III

## 1. Dust Barriers
- Extends beyond the false ceiling to ensure no leakage above the ceiling tiles
- Well-sealed from top to bottom to prevent leakage
- A dedicated single entrance to avoid disturbing the negative pressure
- Sticky mat at the entrance (to trap dust upon exiting the site)

> **Note:** A sign of good negative pressure is seen when the barriers are pulled towards the construction zone

```markdown
# Blucdri AirShield550'

## Xpower Construction Air Handling Unit (CAHU)

- Industrial units that generate enough power to maintain negative pressure in the work area
- They are rigorously tested, and leak tested
- Multiple units are used, depending on the size of the area
- Air enters from one end, passes through multiple filters (including HEPA filter), then comes out filtered from the other end
- Monitoring gauge is used to continuously monitor the negative air pressure (minimum 7.5 Pa in the work area)
- Regular HEPA units in the home CANNOT be used as an alternative as they are not strong enough
```

# Containment Cubes

- A special type of barrier that can be used to contain a small work area
- It is portable and can be easily moved between areas
- Typically used for small construction areas that require Preventive Measures III or IV
- Can be maintained under negative pressure using a CAHU

```markdown
# Preventive Measures IV

In addition to Preventive Measures I, II & III:

- Construct an anteroom at access points to the construction area if access is from within the health care facility. It will always be used as the point of entry into the work area.
- Maintain the anteroom under negative pressure of 7.5 Pa (0.03” WC) relative to the non-construction area.
- Place walk off mats inside and outside the anteroom.
- Ensure construction workers:
- Leave the construction area through the anterooms so they can be vacuumed using a HEPA vacuum cleaner before leaving the worksite; or
- Wear protective clothing that is to be removed each time they leave the construction area and before going into resident care areas.
```

### Restrooms

#### Anteroom

- Anterooms are used if the construction zone must be accessed from within the home.
- If access can be done directly from the outside, then anterooms are not needed.
- They act as an “airlock” where the constructors can stand to vacuum themselves or change their clothing.
- There are two entrances; first entrance into the anteroom, then a second entrance into the construction area.
- They can be made of poly sheets (just like the dust barriers), or they can be solid (e.g., hardboard/gypsum wall).
```

```markdown
# Containment Measures

## Identify the Containment Measure

- Based on the preventive measures, select the type of containment that will be used:
- **Poly Zip wall**: Polyethylene barriers with a zipper to access the area.
- **Poly Zip wall + Hardboard**: Polyethylene barriers with hardboard to reinforce them on the outside (not frequently used).

| Containment Type         | Description                                      |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Containment Cube         |                                                  |
| Poly Zip wall            | Polyethylene barriers with a zipper to access the area. |
| Poly Zip wall + Hardboard| Polyethylene barriers with hardboard to reinforce them on the outside (not frequently used). |
| Anteroom                 |                                                  |
| Drop sheets              |                                                  |
