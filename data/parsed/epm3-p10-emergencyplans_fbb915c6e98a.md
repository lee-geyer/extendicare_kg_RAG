- Detailed roles and responsibilities during an emergency;
- Arrangements with local authorities and institutions to provide shelter and resources;
- Alternate sources to supply emergency power, water, food, and fuel;
- A communications plan; and
- Resident identification procedures, including photographs and identification bracelets.

The home will:
- Develop the ERP in accordance with provincial government and municipal regulations;
- Include community and home stakeholders in the planning process and document their involvement; and
- Review it with the Regional Director/Operations and the Occupational Health and Safety Committee.

The Executive Director/Designate will ensure the following information in the ERP is present and updated as necessary every 6 months and as required:
a. Emergency telephone numbers, including public utilities and government agencies;
