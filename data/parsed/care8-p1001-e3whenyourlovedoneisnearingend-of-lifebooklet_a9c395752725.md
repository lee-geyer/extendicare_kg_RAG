# Introduction

Death is often unpredictable—it may happen suddenly and unexpectedly or unfold gradually over time. This booklet is intended to provide guidance on the physical changes that occur as death approaches. Losing a loved one is an incredibly emotional and challenging experience. While it may be difficult to think about, our goal is to help you understand what to expect and address any questions you may have.

To make this information as accessible as possible, we have structured it in a Question & Answer format. Each section explains the changes that may occur at the end of life, how the care team will respond, and ways you can participate in your loved one’s care.

We recognize that being present during a loved one’s final moments can be both physically and emotionally overwhelming. Your well-being matters, too. One of the most meaningful ways to support your loved one is by also caring for yourself. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if there is anything we can do to support you.

# Extendicare Palliative Care Policy

## Policy Statement
At Extendicare, we recognize:
- That dying is a normal process of life and that no two people experience illness and death in the same way.
- That every individual has a right to be involved in their care, including care decisions at the end of life, as much as they are able.
- As a healthcare team, we are dedicated to ensuring the highest possible quality of life for those who are dying and their families, prioritizing comfort and relief from suffering over curative treatments.

## Philosophy of Care
To our residents, we carry the message of Cicely Saunders, the founder of the Palliative Hospice movement:
> “You matter because you are you, and you matter to the end of your life. We will do all we can, not only to help you die peacefully but also to live until you die.”
> — Cicely Saunders, 1918-2005

# What Happens When Death is Near?

As illness progresses and the body weakens, most vital systems are affected, including:

- The brain and nervous system
- Heart and blood vessels
- Digestive system
- Liver
- Bowels

People often spend more time resting in bed, experiencing weight loss and fatigue, and gradually lose interest in food and fluids. As the body’s systems weaken, they eventually begin to shut down.

## Focus of Care

During this time, the focus of care shifts to comfort rather than treatments or tests. Family caregivers should consider cultural, spiritual, or religious rituals before and at the time of death. Discuss important customs with the healthcare team to ensure they are honored.

Rituals and religious rites may provide comfort, and the healthcare team can help access spiritual support. Share these wishes with the staff for appropriate assistance.

## Common Changes Near the End of Life

This section of the booklet outlines several changes that commonly occur as the body naturally shuts down near the end of life. While not everyone will experience all of these symptoms, many people may encounter some of them.

# Why is my loved one weak?

In the final weeks and days of life, it is common to observe a decrease in energy and declines in day-to-day functioning. A very significant change occurs when the person is no longer strong enough to be out of bed. You may observe your loved one sleeping for long periods of time, tiring quickly, and having trouble arousing.

## What can we do?

- Regular re-positioning of your loved one to prevent skin breakdown and keep them comfortable.
- Provision of pressure-reducing devices and mattresses if needed.
- Planning of care to maximize quiet periods.

## What can you do?

- Plan conversations during periods of alertness.
- Know that your loved one may not be able to participate in conversations but that you can still make ‘small talk.’
- Bring a book or activity to keep yourself occupied while visiting.

# Can They Hear Me? Can They See Me?

As death approaches, vision and hearing are often affected, but it is unclear how much is perceived and processed. Since hearing remains until the moment of death, it is best to assume that conversations are understood and to avoid discussing distressing topics in the presence of a dying loved one.

## What Can We Do?

- Provide time and space for you and your family/friends to have private conversations if needed.
- Relieve dry eyes with eye drops.
- Minimize noise as much as possible.

## What Can You Do?

- Continue being a supportive friend and/or family in the presence of your loved one regardless of how alert they appear. Knowing that family members and/or friends are there and supporting one another can be most comforting to the dying person.
- Keep disagreements away from the bedside.
- Turning toward a soft light source may help improve their eyesight; position yourself at the head of the bed for visits.

# Why are they not eating or drinking?

As death nears, appetite for food and beverages significantly decreases, and feelings of hunger or thirst are rare. The body can no longer process nutrients effectively and attempting to force food or fluids may lead to discomfort, such as choking or nausea.

## What can we do?

- Provide excellent lip and mouth care, including moisture sprays or oral gels.
- Offer small amounts of food, fluids, and ice chips as appropriate.
- Offer nutritional supplements as needed. Involve the Dietitian as needed.
- Provide medications to alleviate nausea.

## What can you do?

- Although it is hard, respect your loved one’s declining interest in food and beverages.
- If your loved one asks for water but cannot drink or your health care team feels it is unsafe for them to drink, good mouth care will keep their mouth and lips moist and give comfort.

**Note:** If your loved one asks for water, you may give water only if the healthcare team has approved it, but please give it slowly and carefully. Raise the head of the bed a little or support your loved one’s head and offer ice chips or small sips of water using a spoon. If the fluid causes coughing or trouble breathing, stop right away.

# Medication Administration at End of Life

## Why are they not taking their medications?
As a person nears the end of life, muscle weakness and difficulty swallowing can make taking medications challenging. Alternative administration methods, such as under the tongue, topical patches, or subcutaneous injections, may be used. The care team may also discontinue unnecessary medications. The Physician or Nurse Practitioner may also review and discontinue medications that are no longer necessary.

## What can we do?
- Assess and monitor for swallowing difficulties.
- Plan for alternate routes of medication administration.

## What can you do?
- Do not force a person to take food, fluids, or medications by mouth if they have swallowing difficulties.
- Discuss medication questions and concerns with the care team.

**Note:** Additionally, some comfort medications can cause dry mouth. Frequent mouth care, moisturizing, and using unscented lip balm can help. Nurses can provide guidance on proper mouth-care techniques. If the nurse gives you a sponge tip swab to help with mouth care, dip it in water and squeeze out extra moisture before you use it in the mouth, along the cheeks, and over the tongue.

# Pain Management at the End of Life

## Are they in pain?
Relieving pain at the end of life is a primary focus. Nursing staff will assess for pain and provide appropriate relief in consultation with the physician or nurse practitioner. Opiates like morphine, alone or combined with other analgesics or anti-inflammatory medications, are commonly used. Moaning or signs of distress such as frowning, wrinkled eyebrows, or tightness around the mouth — may occur during movement or exhalation and often indicate pain. In such cases, medication can be given. These medications will not cause the heart or breathing to stop.

## What can we do?
- Complete accurate pain assessments.
- Provide pain medications in a timely way.
- Plan alternate routes of medication administration when swallowing pills is no longer possible (e.g., under the tongue).

## What can you do?
- Share any concerns you have related to pain level and possible need for medication.
- Provide a soothing environment (soft music, handholding, gentle touch).

# Why are they restless and confused?

Restlessness and agitation near the end of life can stem from reduced oxygen in the brain, medications, or bodily decline, and may be accompanied by restlessness, confusion (often called delirium), decreased alertness, and occasional agitation. Some individuals may misinterpret things (known as illusions), see, hear, or feel things that aren’t actually there (hallucinations), or feel afraid and threatened by their environment (paranoia).

## What can we do?

- Conduct accurate and timely assessments of symptoms to rule out and address any treatable causes of these symptoms.
- Maintain supportive presence and reassurance.
- Provide medications to help reduce anxiety, restlessness, and agitation if needed for symptom management.

## What can you do?

- Provide reassurance with a calm presence, reassuring voice, and handholding.
- Although it may be difficult, if illusions and hallucinations are not distressful to your loved one, avoid correcting or contradicting them.
- Continue to visit, knowing that personality changes are from overall declines near death.

# Changes to Skin in End-of-Life Care

## What is happening to their skin?
Family and friends may notice changes to the person’s skin as circulation decreases. The skin may feel clammy or damp, and blue or purple patches, similar to bruises, may appear on the arms, legs, and underside of the body. While the arms and legs may become cool to the touch, the person remains comfortable. This occurs as blood circulation slows down. The skin, especially on the hands and feet, may feel cool. This is often referred to as mottling by the staff.

## What can we do?
- Provide regular re-positioning.
- Apply skin moisturizer as needed.
- Provide additional blankets if necessary.

## What can you do?
- Have reassurance that your loved one has limited awareness of these changes and is not likely to feel cold or uncomfortable.
- Participate in care by applying moisturizer.
- Avoid bringing hot water bottles or heating pads, as they can burn the skin.
- Consider bringing a washable soft blanket, as it offers warmth without adding extra weight.

# Understanding Twitching Movements at Life's End

## Why do they have twitching movements?
Twitching movements, the loss of reflexes in the arms and legs, and the appearance of primitive reflexes - similar to those seen in newborns - may occur as life nears its end. These reflexes can include grasping, sucking, and rooting.

## What can we do?
- Regular re-positioning of your loved one to prevent skin breakdown and injury from involuntary movements.

## What can you do?
- Recognize that some of the primitive reflexes may be misunderstood. For example, the grasp reflex may cause an object to be held tighter when pulled away. If your loved one squeezes your hand even tighter as you try to say goodbye, it may be a reflex action, not a conscious message of ‘don’t leave me’.

# Breathing Changes in the Dying Process

## What is happening to their breathing?
There will be changes to the person’s regular breathing pattern. These changes in breathing are part of the dying process. They can make family and friends worry or feel upset; however, these are not signs that your loved one is uncomfortable.

Breathing changes are often the most noticeable physical change as death approaches. These may include:
- Deep or shallow breaths
- Fast or slow breathing
- Noisy breathing or gurgling sounds caused by saliva buildup

These noises happen because the person swallows less. Small amounts of fluid will collect in the throat, or the tongue will move back due to the relaxation of the jaw and throat muscles. They may also take shallow breaths with short periods of no breathing. These periods may last from seconds up to a minute.

## What can we do?
- Provide medications for symptom management of secretions and breathing.
- Re-positioning to facilitate easier breathing.

## What can you do?
- Be reassured that noisy breathing is not always a sign of pain or distress, and nursing staff can assist in determining if treatment is needed.

# What happens to bladder and bowel function?

As individuals near the end of life, they consume less food and drink, which results in reduced urine and stool production. Urine may become darker, and there may be no urine output in the final days. Relaxation of the pelvic muscles can lead to a loss of bladder and bowel control. Urine or stool color may change.

## What can we do?
- Manage incontinence with appropriate products.
- Keep skin clean and dry with frequent skin care.

## What can you do?
- Recognize that these changes are normal at the end of life.

# How are they really doing?

As individuals approach the end of life, they may experience a wide range of emotions, including fear of being a burden or the anxiety of dying alone.

## What can we do?
- Provide private visiting time.
- Offer referrals to social work or spiritual care as needed.
- Offer emotional support and contact with community resources.

## What can you do?
- Keep company with your loved one.
- Allow them to express their fears and concerns.
- Reassure them that you will honor their care goals.

# Understanding Death and Dying

## The Experience of Death

No one can know exactly when death will happen. Some people die when others are there, and others take their last breath when they are alone. At this time, family members may experience a range of emotions including:

- Peace and relief
- Sadness
- A release of grief

It is often a time when silence can have great meaning, and when words may not do justice to the moment. Being physically present with one another is important support.

## Personal Experiences of Loss

Everyone has a different experience and a personal sense of loss. Even if dying has been expected for some time, you will not know how that feels until the moment of loss. It may be felt as:

- An end to suffering
- A time of healing and hope

## Choices at the Time of Death

The people closest to a dying person may choose not to be in the same room as their loved one. The decision to try and be present at the moment of death depends on many factors.

- Do not judge others if they choose not to be present around the time of death.

# How do I know my loved one has died?

You will likely observe that breathing stops, and the body is motionless. There will be no heartbeat or pulse, and the pupils will be large and fixed in size.

## What can we do?

- The nursing staff will confirm death and contact the physician.
- We encourage you to take time to say your final goodbyes.

## What can you do?

- Remain at the bedside, touch your loved one, and take your time in saying goodbye.
- When you are ready, nursing staff will contact the funeral home.

## What happens right after a person dies?

- After death, take as much time as you need to say goodbye. You may touch, hold, or kiss your loved one as you feel comfortable and carry out any desired rites and rituals.
- Inform the care team of any personal, cultural, or religious traditions, including how your loved one’s body should be handled and when and how it can be moved.
- If you need guidance on involving children, our staff can support you with conversations about death and provide resources for grieving children.

# Final Thoughts
