## Video Surveillance Device Roommate Consent Form

This consent form is to be completed when a resident, or a resident’s Substitute Decision Maker (SDM), (“the requesting resident”) would like to install a video surveillance device in a shared room. This consent form is to be reviewed and signed by the requesting resident’s roommate or their SDM (“the resident roommate”).

By signing this consent form, the resident roommate is consenting to the installation of a video surveillance device in the shared room.

The resident roommate understands that:

- He or she can review the placement of the video surveillance device with the requesting resident to ensure adequate protection of privacy. The video surveillance device will be placed to only capture the image and sound of the requesting resident wherever possible.
- The video surveillance device cannot record audio or video of other staff/residents/visitors outside of the shared room.
- The video surveillance device should be turned off or covered up during personal care.
- Signage must be posted in the shared room informing other residents, staff, and visitors of the presence of a video surveillance device.
- Audio recording is illegal unless one of the parties involved in that conversation consents to the recording. It is therefore recommended that audio recording be disabled on the video surveillance device.

The following section is to be completed by the resident roommate consenting to the video surveillance device being installed in the shared room.
