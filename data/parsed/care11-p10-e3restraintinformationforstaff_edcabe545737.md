## Restraint Information for Staff

### Our Purpose
Helping people live better. We are committed to offering residents a safe and dignified environment, adhering to a “least restraint” philosophy. Our LTC homes strive to avoid the use of physical restraints, recognizing their potential harm to residents. Care and services are organized to meet safety and security needs while respecting residents' rights to autonomy, independence, and dignity. We believe in fostering a caring and minimally restrictive environment where residents can make choices and maintain their sense of well-being.

### Our Commitment:
- Thorough and regular resident assessments by the care team.
- Individualized plans of care & comprehensive documentation when restraints are used.
- Evaluation of all other alternatives means of protecting the resident and/or others to minimize the use of restraints.
- Ongoing staff education on all policies related to restraint use.
- Restraints will be used as little as possible for the shortest duration of time, only as a last resort and be the least restrictive possible.

Extendicare’s goal is for residents to be “independent to the best of their ability and rarely experience daily physical restraints.”

### Reasons for Restraint Use:
Restraints are sometimes used when a resident might harm themselves or others and when other strategies haven’t worked. However, restraints should only be used temporarily and only after trying other options, like calming techniques or crisis management. There are three main types of restraints: Physical, Chemical, and Environmental. For more information, check our Restraint & PASD policy.

### Why Reducing the Use of Physical Restraints is Important:
Using physical restraints can lead to harm and other health issues for residents, such as:
- Physical problems like pain, skin sores, or injuries.
- Mental health effects like anxiety, depression, confusion, or feeling isolated.
- Functional issues like difficulty with bladder control, constipation, or an increased risk of falling due to weakened muscles and balance.
- Serious risks like getting trapped, drowsiness, or even death.

### How Our Team Can Help Reduce the Use of Restraints:
Before considering restraints, try other solutions like:
- Using fall mats, adjusting bed heights (hi/low beds), or using bed/chair alarms.
- Referring to physiotherapy or restorative care to help with positioning, balance, and moving.
- Pay attention to behavior patterns that might cause falls.
- Keep personal items and water close by for residents and take them to the bathroom often to avoid falls.
- Understand that certain behaviors could be caused by things like pain or infections.
- Learn what calms each resident, and use those methods to reduce restlessness, like:
- Doing activities residents enjoy or asking activity staff for suggestions.
- Sitting with the resident, holding their hand, and talking.

## Strategies for Calming Residents
- Offering a snack or drink.

## Ideas for Residents Who Are Unsteady or Wander
- Include joint exercises and walking in their daily care.
- Provide safe walking paths indoors and outdoors, with resting spots.
- Reduce the use of wheelchairs unless needed for transportation.
- Consider reducing medications that make residents unsteady.
- Keep residents busy with activities related to their past interests, reducing wandering.

## What Nurses Need to Know About Restraints
Nurses use their clinical judgment to decide if restraints are needed, always keeping resident safety first. While input from residents and families is important, nurses aren’t required to use restraints solely based on family member or SDM requests; it should be part of an interdisciplinary team discussion.

## Purpose of This Document
This information sheet aims to educate healthcare professionals on the considerations, risks, alternatives, and ethical obligations associated with the use of restraints in healthcare settings.
