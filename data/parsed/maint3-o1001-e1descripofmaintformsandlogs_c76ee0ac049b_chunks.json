If maintenance staff do not work on any day (such as a Sunday or a vacation), then the form should be marked to indicate that the daily work was not done on that day. This can be done by striking a line or an ‘X’ over the column for that day.On the form, each day is divided into three columns.",

      "section_title": "Description of Maintenance Forms and LogsIn the Maintenance Program, there are samples of forms that have been found to be useful in organizing the maintenance work and keeping a record that the work was done. Some facilities may choose to use different forms to organize their programs or may choose to use a computer-based system. The actual method or form used to organize the maintenance work is not significant, provided an organized system is in place that accomplishes the same results. A brief explanation of how to use each of the sample forms follows:### Daily LogThis form is designed to help maintenance staff remember to do the most important daily activities. It should be used as a guide to help ensure that these tasks are completed every day that maintenance workers are on duty. One page (both sides) should be used for an entire week. If maintenance staff do not work on any day (such as a Sunday or a vacation), then the form should be marked to indicate that the daily work was not done on that day. This can be done by striking a line or an ‘X’ over the column for that day.On the form, each day is divided into three columns. This allows information to be recorded for up to three similar items, such as three boilers or temperature readings in three different rooms. On page 2, there are also places where multiple lines are used for the same item, such as fire exit doors and CO detectors. This allows a record to be made for up to 15 fire exit doors (five lines by three columns) and 12 CO detectors (four lines by three columns).When completing this form, some responses will require a number (such as water temperature) and other responses will require that ‘OK’ be written. This is needed to demonstrate to compliance officials that the building has been inspected.**NOTE:** Once completed, log sheets shall be permanent records of inspection. Current log sheets for a given year should be filed in three-ring binders. Older log sheets should be filed in manila folders and maintained as inactive records.### Annual CalendarThe Annual Maintenance Calendar can be used to indicate critical dates of any maintenance service contracts (i.e., renewal date as well as months in which inspections or services are scheduled). It provides a simple place to record when any annual or semiannual inspections are required, such as fire alarm inspections or electrical generator inspections.A separate Annual Maintenance Calendar can also be used to help schedule the annual inspections and repairs of the resident rooms and inspections of resident-owned equipment. The room numbers can be distributed across the calendar so that every month some of the rooms are addressed with the intention that all of the rooms will be inspected by the end of the year. This allows the work to be carried out in a more organized manner.### Service Firm LogThis form was created to help record the visit(s) of each service provider performing work on or within the facility. The log is in strategic locations throughout the home, such as the front entrance, the maintenance office, the kitchen, etc. Contractors are asked to sign in and out when entering the building and to describe in a few words what they were called to do. This record can then be used when questioning the time charged on invoices from the contractor.----**Helping people live better**This document is uncontrolled when printed.

      "text": "When this happens, the maintenance workers are expected to be flexible and deal with the issue, then carry out the preventive maintenance at another time or another day later in the month. There may be times when the preventive maintenance for a piece of equipment cannot be carried out during that month. This is not unusual and in most situations not critical to the operation of the equipment. However, if a procedure cannot be completed one month, then it should definitely not be missed the following month.## Maintenance Request LogThe Maintenance Request Log is a simple way for staff, residents, or visitors to advise maintenance of a need to have something repaired. Generally, blank copies of these pages are inserted into 3-ring binders and distributed throughout the home in locations where people can easily find them and enter requests for maintenance. Most homes place one copy of the binder at each nursing station and at the main reception desk. Anyone who sees something in need of repair can simply write on the form what is required and in which room.This document is uncontrolled when printed. Extendicare (Canada) Inc.",

      "section_title": "Description of Maintenance Forms and LogsMaintenance workers must check each logbook when completing the morning rounds, review the requests, insert a priority number for each entry, and develop a plan to carry out the repairs. For example, if several books have entries related to lights not working, maintenance could plan on tending to all these lighting problems consecutively before addressing another series of problems, such as repairing all leaking faucets. Anything given a priority of 1 (such as a damaged nurse call) should be addressed right away. Once the repairs have been completed, the maintenance person should enter the log that the corrective action was taken, so that the person who requested it can see that it was done. Maintenance may want to check the log several times during the day, preferably once in the morning and once in the afternoon, in case new items have been added during the day. If some items on the Maintenance Request Log cannot be completed within a reasonable time, then the maintenance person should write on the log the reason for the delay (such as “parts on order – expected in three days”) so that the person requesting the work has some idea of why it has not been completed and when they should expect it to be done. Maintenance should review these logs on a weekly basis to ensure that any incomplete items have been addressed and repaired.## Temperature LogThe Temperature Log is provided to allow kitchen and laundry staff to monitor and record water or air temperatures for a variety of kitchen and laundry equipment (e.g., washers, dryers, etc.). Blank pages of the log should be inserted into 3-ring binders, one of which is left in the kitchen and one left in the laundry where department staff can complete the log. The date can be written in the blank spaces that are provided below the days of the week. Indicate the name of the equipment being monitored in the blank space in the left column above the word “Time”. Record the temperatures taken in the row to the right of the equipment name. Record the time at which temperatures are taken in the row to the right of the heading “Time”. Initial the notations in the space provided to the right of the heading “Initial”.Columns 1, 2, and 3 are provided under each weekday heading to accommodate up to three (3) recordings per day.## Monthly Maintenance ReportThe Monthly Maintenance Report is a report from the Maintenance Department to the Executive Director and should be completed at the end of each month. It is intended to summarize the significant data and events that occurred during the preceding month and provide a brief history of what has occurred over the month. It will place emphasis on:- Highlights of inspection and tests",
