## 3. What will you do if there is a potential outbreak, or suspected outbreak in your home?

Consider:
- Who will do the contact tracing for both residents and staff to provide to Public Health?
- What are your isolation procedures?

**Example:** We have created a checklist with the procedures of what to do in the event of an outbreak including key contact numbers. A contingency plan with respect to human resources has been developed that identifies minimum staffing needs and prioritizes critical and non-essential services based on residents’ health status, functional limitations, disabilities, and essential facility operations, and considers staffing needs in outbreak and non-outbreak scenarios, and the expectation of increased staff absenteeism during outbreaks.

### Outline process for implementation of Cohorting Plan
