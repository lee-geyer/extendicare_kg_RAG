## Honoring Residents at End-of-Life Program Ideas

Homes may consider implementing some or all these ideas:

- Informing staff, family members, and other residents of a resident’s change in condition. Please consider using meaningful visual symbols when end of life is near, such as:
- Laminated picture of a dove
- A dove that says “Peace begins at a single moment”
- Laminated picture of a butterfly
- Hummingbird

- Conducting a stand-up meeting when a resident is placed on palliative care. All departments should attend this meeting to review a palliative care plan. The plan should outline each department's responsibilities and be personalized to meet the specific needs of the residents and their families. Clear communication with the family and the residents about their wishes and needs for end-of-life care is essential.

- Collaborating with local hospices. Where available, involve hospice organizations to provide additional support and expertise.

- Using a door symbol to signify palliative care. Place a designated symbol on the resident’s door to indicate their palliative status sensitively and respectfully.

## Palliative Doves

- **Symbol of Palliative Care:** Each nursing station may have a medium-sized decorative box containing Palliative Care Doves, which can be sourced from local stores. These white doves are perched on beaded garlands and fastened to suction cups. Once a resident is confirmed to be palliative, a dove is placed on their nameplate outside their door to signify their status.

- **Acknowledging the Dove Symbol:** When you see a dove, it signifies that a resident is nearing the end of life. Take a moment to visit the residents to pay your respects and bid them farewell, if appropriate. Be mindful that family and friends may be present and grieving inside the room. Please exercise discretion and sensitivity when entering, regardless of your role or department.

- **Volunteer Support:** Volunteers may take shifts sitting with the resident to ensure they are not alone when family or staff cannot be present.

- **Hospitality for Families and Volunteers:** The nursing department may provide meals and snacks for family members or volunteers during regular snacks and mealtimes to ensure their comfort and well-being.

- **Cultural and Personal Requests:** Special ceremonies, such as Sweet Grass Ceremonies or drum processions, may be arranged to honor the residents’ cultural or spiritual preferences. These ceremonies can take place within the home as needed.

- **Palliative Care Room:** Whenever possible, residents receiving palliative care should be moved to a private or designated palliative care room. This space allows family members to visit or stay with the resident around the clock and offers privacy for rituals or practices they may wish to perform.

- **Comfortable Accommodations for Families:** Consider providing a pull-out sofa or couch in the residents’ room for family members to rest. Alternatively, portable cots or reclining chairs that can be used for sleeping may also be made available.

## ENHANCING COMFORT FOR PALLIATIVE CARE RESIDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES

### Soothing Environment:
- Provide a CD player with a diverse selection of music, including options beyond hymns.
- Use soft lighting to create a calming atmosphere.

### Cozy Bedding:
- Supply flannel pajamas (for men and women), flannel sheets, and pillowcases to make the bed more comfortable and inviting.
- Offer body pillows for added support and comfort.

### Temperature Control:
- Provide a fan to help keep the resident cool.

### Palliative Care Cart:
A well-stocked Palliative Care Cart can be taken to the resident’s room to meet the needs of both the resident and their family. Suggested items to include:

| **Category**                     | **Items**                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

These additions are designed to provide physical comfort, emotional support, and a welcoming space for residents and their families during palliative care.

## HONORING RESIDENTS WHO HAVE PASSED AWAY

### Door Symbols:
- A symbol can be placed on the resident’s door to indicate their passing. This informs staff, on all shifts, family members, and other residents.
- An angel symbol serves to alert staff that a resident has passed away, ensuring they are aware before entering the room.
- Alternatively, a butterfly sign may be used, featuring the phrase: “Butterflies have the Softest Touch.” This is particularly helpful for staff, such as housekeeping, who may have formed close bonds with residents but might not otherwise be notified immediately.

### Honor Guard Ceremony:
- When a resident has passed and the funeral home arrives to remove their resident, a “Code Angel” may be announced over the sound system. This prompts all movements in the hallways to pause, allowing everyone to pay their respects.
- Staff, residents, and family members who are able may gather in the hall or follow the resident to the front door to honor their life.

# Honoring Residents at End-of-Life Program Ideas

## The Passage Quilt
- The Passage Quilt is a beautiful homemade quilt that is used when a resident passes away, to cover the body of the resident as the body is taken from the residence. It is a softer image that will stay with the family members, other residents, staff, and volunteers as they look back on this time of sadness and loss.

## Farewell Blankets
- Two farewell blankets may be used to honor residents: one featuring a large cross and another non-denominational.
- When a resident passes, the blanket can be draped over the body as they are escorted out through the front door. Funeral home staff treat the blanket with great respect, folding it as they would a national flag and returning it to the home.
- Available staff and managers may line up the halls to pay their respects and escort the resident and family to the awaiting vehicle.
- For veterans, the Canadian flag may be used in the same manner.

## Sympathy Gesture
- A red rose and a sympathy card may be left on the deceased resident’s bed as a gesture of compassion for the family.

## Memorial Book/Board
- A wooden plaque or board at reception or in the chapel can display the name and photo of a resident who has passed away.
- A memorial book beneath the display may include the resident’s name and date of passing.
- A battery-operated candle may be lit from the time of death until after the funeral.

## Candelabra Alternative
- A candelabra and an “In Memory” book may be placed at the front entrance. When a resident passes, the candelabra may be lit and kept illuminated until the resident’s funeral. After the funeral, a blue rose can be delivered to the resident’s family with condolences from the home.

## Memorial Binder
- A Memorial Binder, kept in the chapel, can include write-ups of special moments shared by staff, funeral details, and tributes.
- Residents and staff can reflect on the binder to remember those who have passed. Anyone is welcome to contribute memories.

## Memorial Service
- Depending on the size of the home, memorial services may be held quarterly, semi-annually, or annually.
- Families of deceased residents may receive an invitation to the service, where they can light a flameless (battery-operated) candle in memory of their loved one.
- The service can feature a sign-in book, photos of the residents, and bulletins. Carnations may be distributed to family members.
- Copies of the service memories and bulletins can be mailed to families unable to attend.

## Cultural Sensitivity
- A reference booklet outlining end-of-life practices for different cultural and religious beliefs should be available for staff.
- The booklet may include information on funeral or memorial service customs, appropriate guest etiquette, interment practices, ways to offer condolences, and how the body is treated after death.
