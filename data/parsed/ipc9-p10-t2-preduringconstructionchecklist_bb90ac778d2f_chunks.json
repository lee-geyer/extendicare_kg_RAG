Isolation and Containment\n- The HVAC system in the construction zone has been isolated. - Drop sheets are used to contain the work area and the dust generated. - A walk-off mat is placed at the entrance to and exit from the construction area.### III. Dust Barrier and Pressure Maintenance\n- An impermeable dust barrier is erected from the floor to the underside of the deck (including the areas above false ceilings) consisting of two layers of 0.15 mm (6 mil) poly plastic sheets. - If applicable, a containment cube is constructed around the work area. - A minimum negative pressure of 7.5 Pa is maintained at all times in the construction zone.### IV. Anteroom Construction\n- An anteroom is constructed at access points to the construction area if access is from within the home. - A walk-off mat is placed outside and inside the anteroom to trap dust from equipment, debris, and the footwear of personnel leaving the construction area.",

Construction Debris Management\n- The construction debris is removed at the end of each day, at minimum. - The area is vacuumed frequently (with a HEPA-filtered vacuum) and wet mopped daily with a medical-grade low level disinfectant. - The pressure of the construction area must be monitored daily, ensuring that a minimum negative pressure of 7.5 Pa is maintained in the construction area.### IV. Access Control\n- Ensure that entry into and exit from the construction area takes place through the anteroom only. This will ensure that the negative pressure is well maintained. - Workers are to HEPA vacuum their clothing, including their boots, in the anteroom before leaving the construction zone.",
