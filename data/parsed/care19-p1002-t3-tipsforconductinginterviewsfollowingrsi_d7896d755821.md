## Objective
Interviews following a resident safety incident (RSI) are key to collecting information for analysis and help to support those directly involved in the incident. An interview is often the first opportunity that a resident, family member, or healthcare provider has to share their detailed perspective about the incident. Interviews should be conducted as soon as reasonably possible after an RSI to ensure valuable information is not lost over time. This guide provides leaders with tips on how to effectively gather information in the interview step of the investigation.

## General Principles
- Convey compassion, empathy, and respect.
- Appreciate that supportive discussion can help staff come to terms with what has happened; conversely, confrontational and judgmental comments may lead to demoralization and defensiveness.
- Keep an open mind; there is a natural tendency to accept the first account as accurate and to weigh subsequent versions accordingly.

# Interview Guidelines

## Recognizing Stress and Memory

- Recognize that due to stress, participants may have a poor concept of the passage of time and may confuse the sequence of events.
- Use listening skills (e.g., head nodding, allowing for pauses and silence).
- Recognize that hindsight is 20/20. Events are not always within the control of the persons involved. Outcomes are not always evident.
- Evaluate decisions/actions based on what was going on at the time.
- Ask, “How did that make sense at the time?”
- Avoid oversimplification and jumping to conclusions. Acknowledge complexity.

## Note Taking

Given the potential for subsequent legal proceedings, establish the practice of:

- Having the same person take notes across all interviews.
- Limiting note taking to elements that will help in preparation of a final report (e.g., new facts about the case, issues identified, and suggestions for improvement).
- Retaining written notes only until the final report is completed, then shredding them.

Note taking may make some interviewees uneasy. Explain the purpose, take only essential notes, and maintain as much eye contact as possible. Verbatim transcripts or voice recordings are neither necessary nor recommended.

## Pre-Interview

- Conduct interviews as soon as possible while memories are fresh and before discussions with others distort recollections.
- Interview each individual involved, if possible.
- Interview each individual one at a time, if possible. If not possible, interview in small groups (e.g., 2-3 nurses working the same shift).
- Conduct interviews in person, if possible.
- Plan to have all members of the review team present for all interviews, if possible.
- Provide verbal (through the individual’s manager) or written invitation including:
- Purpose of interview
- What to expect
- Preparation required (if any)
- Time, place, and estimated length of interview

## During the Interview

- Establish early rapport to help reduce anxiety and stress.
- Provide opening statements:

- Emphasize expectations related to confidentiality, such as:
- The contents of the interview remain confidential to protect the integrity of the investigation (especially when multiple staff are involved)

# Interview Guidelines for Incident Review

## Promoting Effective Narrative

- Promote free narrative/story telling (e.g. tell us what happened? start at the beginning? tell us about the shift).
- Avoid interruptions as they may reduce memory recall.
- Ask open-ended questions:
- What happened next?
- How did that make sense at the time?
- What else was going on that impacted the assessment of the situation?
- Avoid leading questions (e.g. did you call the doctor then?).
- Explore goal-conflicts:
- Why was there a gap between what happened and what was supposed to happen?
- Explore specific factors that they think might have contributed to the incident.
- Explore factors that they feel helped mitigate the outcome (e.g. what went well?).
- Explore the timeline and identify any discrepancies and/or new information.
- Acknowledge that staff are a great source for improvement ideas and ask if they have any suggestions.
- Try to ask follow-up questions in the order that the event unfolded to aid information retrieval.

## Closing the Interview

- Ask if they have any other comments to make or questions to ask.
- Attempt to leave the interviewee in a positive frame of mind, reiterate the purpose is fact-finding and identifying opportunities for improvement.
- Outline next steps.
- Avoid making promises about a specific timeline, final recommendations, or the ability for them to access the final report.
- Thank the interviewee for their time and cooperation.
- Provide contact information if they think of anything else they want to add at a later date.
- Have information available on staff support/counselling, if required, based on the nature of the case or the interviewee’s personal involvement such as EAP.

## Post Interview

- Look for consistent themes.
- Follow up on any discrepancies.
- Ensure any new facts identified are recorded in the health record.
