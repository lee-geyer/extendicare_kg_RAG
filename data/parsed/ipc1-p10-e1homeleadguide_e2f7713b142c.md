# Ethical Decision-Making in IPAC

To ensure that you are using an ethical approach in your decisions, ensure that your resident and family councils, and your home’s ethics committee are consulted as issues arise.

## Precautionary Principle

19. Apply the precautionary principle when providing recommendations and/or revising the IPAC Program in the home in collaboration with local public health or regional health authorities, IPAC Consultants, and the Chief Medical Officer.

The Precautionary Principle means that in a time when there is uncertainty in the scientific evidence about virus transmission, it is better to apply the highest level IPAC measures possible to protect workers and the public.

20. Consult with an IPAC Consultant when facing challenges in the home that might impact existing IPAC best practices and standards.

# Staff Immunizations

Extendicare launches an annual influenza campaign with a goal of reaching a 90% immunization rate for staff and residents. Here are some tips on how to set up a successful campaign in your home:

1. Use the Employee Influenza Intention Form to determine early on which staff members are willing to receive the influenza vaccine. This will help you focus your education and efforts on staff that are hesitant.
Ensure the Staff Immunization/TB Testing Record is completed upon hire for each staff member.

2. Keep separate lists of influenza-immunized staff and non-immunized staff. In regions where required, report staff immunization rates to the local public health authority and complete any other jurisdictional specific reports. You can use the Staff Immunization/Antiviral Treatment Tracking Report.
**MANITOBA:** Follow provincial/regional guidelines to submit a record of all immunizations given in the home (residents and staff).

Offer multiple influenza vaccination clinics for staff and maintain documentation for staff who attend the clinic. Data collected can be used to report homes’ vaccination rates.

3. Request proof of influenza vaccination when a staff member has received the current vaccine elsewhere (other than Extendicare home).

# Resident Vaccinations & Screening

Vaccinations and screening for infectious diseases are part of the resident admission process:

1. Residents must be offered vaccinations based on the 8 Canadian Immunization Guide (including COVID-19 and influenza (seasonally), pneumonia, tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) at the time of admission.
- Refer to **Immunization, Residents and Staff** policy.
- **MANITOBA**: Homes can make a request for personal health information to Public Health for a Public Health Information Management System (PHIMS) Vaccination record. This record will also identify overdue or coming due vaccinations.

2. Ensure that each resident admitted is screened for tuberculosis within 14 days of admission. There must be documented results for the screening process.
- Refer to **Resident Immunization** policy.
- Routine tuberculin skin testing on (or prior to) admission and periodic tuberculin skin tests (such as annually) are not recommended for residents.

3. Residents must be screened for Multi-Drug Resistant Organisms (MDROs), such as MRSA & VRE, upon admission and upon return from a hospital stay that lasted 12+ hours.
- Depending on your provincial guidance or local public health authority, there may be a requirement to swab residents for MDROs upon admission/re-admission from hospital.

> **TIP**: Ensure to follow local public health authority guidelines regarding MDRO screening.

# Reprocessing of Critical Medical Devices/Equipment

Critical Medical Devices/Equipment (e.g., wound care, foot care, dental care) are often used in your home and must be reprocessed (i.e., clean, disinfected, sterilized, and packaged) to ensure resident safety.

## Your Role as an IPAC Home Lead/Manager or ICSA

1. Inform and coordinate with your Administrator to ensure that any externally contracted service provider who uses critical equipment signs the updated contract which includes an IPAC section with expectations for reprocessing.
2. On a quarterly basis, collect the Medical Devices and Equipment Reprocessing Checklist from your external service provider. This ensures best practice and the requirement for proof of appropriate reprocessing.
3. On a quarterly basis, conduct a visual audit of the reprocessed equipment that is being brought into the home using the dedicated audit on Surge Learning called IC-Critical Medical Devices/Equipment Audit.
