Upon discovering that a resident has fallen, staff should:\n- Stop and scan the environment for safety hazards before approaching the resident. - Call the nurse and remain with the resident. - If the resident is unconscious, follow Extendicare’s emergency policies and procedures. - Do not move the resident. - Once the nurse assesses the resident and deems it safe, assist the resident off the floor using a mechanical lift and additional staff.2. A Post-Fall Assessment must be completed by a nurse. This assessment includes:\n- A post-fall huddle\n- An evaluation of potential injuries\n- A review of the events leading up to the fall\n- Identification of environmental risk factors\n- An analysis of contributing factors\n- Determination of the probable root cause3. Vitals signs must be monitored for a minimum of 72 hours. If the fall was unwitnessed or the resident hit their head, the Head Injury Routine must be initiated (hourly monitoring for 4 hours and once every shift after, for 72 hours after the fall).4. After a fall, the nurse must review the resident’s most current fall risk level.",

If the resident is not already identified as high risk, the nurse must complete the Integrated Fall Risk Assessment to determine any changes in the resident’s risk level.5.
