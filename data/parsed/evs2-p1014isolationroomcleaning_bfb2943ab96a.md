## POLICY

### Cleaning and Organization

## PROCEDURE

### Manager/Designate:
- Ensure housekeeping staff are trained in the proper procedures for cleaning an isolation room.
- Ensure hospital grade disinfectant with a 5-minute contact time or less is being used for cleaning isolation rooms.
- **Note:** Except in C. difficile rooms (see Tools or C. difficile policy).
- Visually monitor that staff is following correct procedures.
- Notify housekeeping staff when a final clean is required.
- Ensure staff has all the cleaning supplies and tools they need.
- If resident room is scheduled for additional cleaning routines or floor buffing procedures, reschedule until isolation is over.

### Housekeeping staff:
- During cleaning, follow infection prevention and control practices. Wear the proper personal protective equipment (PPE).
- Clean isolation rooms last to reduce the risk of cross contamination.
- Clean isolation rooms daily:
1. Check with Charge Nurse for any rooms in isolation.
2. Follow any additional precautions indicated on posted precaution signs.
3. Follow manufacturer's instructions for proper contact time for cleaning and disinfecting; change cleaning chemical to low-level hospital-grade disinfectant with a 5-minute contact time or less and let air dry. If unsure of disinfectant to use, contact the manager.
4. Make sure you have everything you need before you enter the room to clean and avoid making trips in and out of the room. Be as quiet as possible so as not to disturb the resident.
5. Clean hands when you enter the room using hand sanitizer (ABHR). If hands are visibly soiled, perform proper hand washing before entering the room.
6. Follow regular cleaning routines for resident room and washroom cleaning.
7. Pay special attention to high-touch surfaces such as bedside tables, bed rails, call bell cords, light switches, door handles, grab bars, and telephones.
8. Damp dusting and mopping is preferred over dry dusting or sweeping. When damp mopping, use neutral floor cleaner and rinse mop frequently.
9. Clean hands when you leave the room using hand sanitizer (ABHR).
