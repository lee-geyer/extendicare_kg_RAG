Only one home is affected and there is little to no potential for media coverage. **Example:** An elevator in a home breaks down. |\n| **Stage 2: Moderate** | A home-specific issue has occurred but poses no immediate risk of occurring at another home. The event or issue poses a potential threat to resident safety and Extendicare’s reputation/operations. There is potential for broader media coverage.",

There is potential for broader media coverage. **Example:** A mechanical lift or sling, used in the majority of homes, malfunctions and causes a non-life threatening injury to a resident. |\n| **Stage 3: High** | An incident has occurred that may harm or has the potential to harm residents or staff, affect operations, and/or severely damage the company’s reputation. The issue may pose a potential risk to numerous homes and media coverage is expected. **Examples:** Physical assault to resident/employee; resident elopement in bad weather; inclement weather is preventing food deliveries and power outages are being experienced. |\n| **Stage 4: Critical** | A major crisis which has already caused harm to residents and/or staff, affected operations, and/or severely damaged the company’s reputation. Media has been contacting the home(s) and/or corporate office. **Example:** A resident dies as a result of asphyxiation from a restraint; resident is seriously injured; sexual assault of a resident; an explosion, gas leak or fire is forcing the immediate evacuation of the home.",
