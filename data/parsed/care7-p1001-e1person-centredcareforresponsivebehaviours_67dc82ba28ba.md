## Person-Centred Care for Responsive Behaviours

### What is person-centred care?
Person-centred care is an approach that respects the unique values, history, culture, and preferences of individuals, promoting dignity, collaboration, and quality of life in care. Person-centred care focuses on residents’ strengths, capabilities, preferences, and priorities and is adapted to their varying cognitive abilities and communication styles.

### What is dementia?
Dementia is a syndrome characterized by a decline in cognitive function that interferes with a person’s ability to perform everyday activities. It is caused by various diseases or injuries that affect the brain.

### What are responsive behaviours?
Responsive behaviours refer to actions, words, or gestures that may arise as expressions of unmet needs, discomfort, or distress. These behaviours are often a response to the person’s environment, interactions, or underlying medical or psychological conditions.

### What might we see with responsive behaviours?
- **Physical and verbal agitation/restlessness:** Can stem from physical discomfort, emotional distress, or environmental triggers.
- **Verbal outbursts:** Often signal frustration, fear, or the need for attention.
- **Wandering:** May reflect boredom, confusion, or a desire for familiar spaces.
- **Key insight:** Responsive behaviours are not intentional—they are a way for people with dementia to communicate when language is limited.

### What are common causes of responsive behaviours?
Understanding the underlying causes is critical for effective management. Considerations include, as part of the Behavioural Facts & Findings section of the Mental Health – Behavioural Rounds & Incident Debrief Tool:
- **Biological:**
- Untreated pain (e.g., arthritis, dental issues)
- Side effects from medications (e.g., sedation, confusion)
- Sensory deficits (e.g., hearing or vision loss)

# Responsive Behaviours in Care

## Psychological Factors
- **Anxiety or depression** due to cognitive decline
- **Delirium** (acute confusion) from infections or medication changes
(See Education: Delirium – Plan of Care Considerations)

## Social/Environmental Factors
- **Inadequate lighting**, overstimulation, unfamiliar environments
- **Changes in routine** or care providers

## Personal Factors
- **Unmet needs** (e.g., hunger, thirst, toileting)
- **Loss of autonomy** leading to distress

## Key Insights
- Get to know the person to find ways to emphasize their life story
- Engage the family
- Recognize the resident’s early signs of discomfort
- Focus on the resident’s environment to find person-centred ways to create a calming environment with familiar surroundings to reduce triggers

----

## Strategies for Responsive Behaviours

### Proactive Strategies to Minimize the Likelihood of Responsive Behaviours:
- **Person-centred care:**
- Develop personalized care plans using the resident’s history and preferences.
- Involve family members in care decisions and regular reviews.
- Consider the resident’s spiritual/religious preferences in their care.

- **Environmental modifications:**
- Offer quiet spaces for rest and reduce overstimulation.
- Design spaces that promote safe wandering (e.g., circular paths).

- **Early identification:**
- Conduct routine assessments for physical discomfort and emotional health using validated assessment tools.
- Observe patterns and document triggers to tailor interventions.

### Key Insights
- Consistent documentation and team collaboration to maintain person-centred care
- Provide activities & recreation that promote meaningful, joyful engagement.

# De-escalation Strategies for Responsive Behaviours

De-escalation is vital during episodes of escalated responsive behaviours:

## 1. Pause and Observe (if no risk of harm to self or others):
- Assess the environment and the resident’s emotional state.
- Identify potential triggers (e.g., noise, pain, hunger).

## 2. Engage:
- Speak in a calm, reassuring tone.
- Use familiar phrases and validate feelings.

## 3. Redirect:
- Offer an enjoyable or soothing activity (e.g., a favourite song).
- Offer conversation that engages the resident to redirect attention to something else.

## 4. Adjust Environment:
- Reduce stimuli and provide comfort.
- Reduce loud noises, bright lights, or other environmental stressors.

# Non-Pharmacological Interventions

Non-drug approaches can often effectively manage responsive behaviours:

## 1. Music and Art Therapy:
- Music linked to personal memories can reduce agitation and increase engagement.
- Calming and engaging.

## 2. Sensory Stimulation:
- Gentle touch, aromatherapy (where appropriate), or soothing visuals can offer comfort.

## 3. Physical Activity:
- Regular movement supports better sleep and reduces restlessness.
- Walks, exercise programs.

## 4. Social Interaction:
- Structured group activities combat isolation and boredom.
- Meaningful conversations.
- Visits from pets.

## 5. Key Insight:
- Promote tailoring experiences to the resident’s evolving interests.

# Effective Communication Techniques

## Key Techniques
- Use clear, simple language.
- Approach calmly and respectfully.
- Validate feelings and provide reassurance.
- Non-verbal communication: Maintain eye contact, use a calm tone.

# Understanding Responsive Behaviours

The Mental Health – Behaviour Rounds & Incident Debrief Tool has guiding questions to help team members better understand and manage responsive behaviours by recognizing patterns and implementing effective interventions. For example, the guiding questions prompt analysis for:

- What was happening before the behaviour, including triggers and environmental factors.
- A description of the observed behaviour.
- What is happening immediately after the behaviour, including how staff respond and what the resident does next.

## Key Takeaways
- Responsive behaviours are a form of communication.
- Effective communication and de-escalation are essential.
- Collaborate with the care team and continuously adapt strategies.
- Management requires a holistic, person-centred approach.
