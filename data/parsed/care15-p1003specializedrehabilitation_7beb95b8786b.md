## POLICY

### Restorative Care

### PROCEDURE

Specialized rehabilitation services are integrated into the restorative care philosophy through person-centred, goal-directed approaches focused on optimizing residents’ physical, cognitive, and communication abilities to support independence and quality of life.

- **Specialized rehabilitation services may include the following:**
- **Physiotherapy (PT):** Fall prevention, mobility, gait training, strength, and balance.
- **Occupational Therapy (OT):** Fine motor skills, activities of daily living (ADLs), adaptive equipment, and environmental modifications.
- **Speech-Language Pathology (SLP):** Communication, swallowing, cognitive-linguistic rehab (i.e., attention, memory, problem solving).

- Specialized therapies are provided in coordination with other restorative care services to ensure holistic interventions are aligned with resident goals, strengths, needs, and functional potential.

- Services must be delivered in a manner that respects residents’ language, culture, and communication needs, wherever possible.

- The resident and/or Substitute Decision Maker (SDM)/Power of Attorney (POA) are encouraged to actively participate in setting goals and developing individualized rehabilitation plans, in collaboration with the interdisciplinary team.

- Referrals to PT, OT, or SLP are initiated:
- Within 24 hours of move-in, if determined necessary by a member of the interdisciplinary team (e.g., nursing, clinical program lead, Registered Dietitian).
- Upon a significant change in resident’s status affecting mobility, function, or communication.
- Post fall, at the discretion of the nurse or Clinical Restorative Care Co-Lead, to evaluate changes in functional status, mobility, and fall risk.

- Therapists must complete an initial, discipline-specific assessment in a timely manner based on clinical urgency and applicable service agreements.

- The interdisciplinary team must further evaluate specialized rehab potential using the interRAI assessment at move-in, quarterly, and upon significant change in status.

- Based on outcomes, the Clinical Restorative Care Co-Lead may make a referral to the Restorative Care Coordinating Committee (RCCC) and complete the Restorative Needs Assessment & Evaluation to determine eligibility for specialized rehab.

### DESCRIPTION: Specialized Rehabilitation

----

- An individualized treatment plan must be developed and regularly reviewed to address evolving restorative care needs (e.g., mobility, ADLs, communication).
- Plans must be aligned with interRAI assessments and, where applicable, with the provincial interRAI process and Special Rehab Resource Utilization Group (RUG) criteria:
- One or more therapies provided >5 days/week during the observation period.
- Each session lasting >15 minutes.
- Total therapy minutes across all disciplines documented (refer to the Restorative Care Programs Guide).
- Group therapy must maintain a maximum 1:4 therapist-to-resident ratio, with participants sharing similar goals and needs.
- Group or concurrent therapies do not replace individualized therapy when clinically indicated. Sessions that are not rehab goal-based can be led by recreation staff.
- Therapists are responsible for developing individualized plans and can delegate interventions to trained staff, such as therapy or restorative aides, recreation staff.
- Delegated staff must receive training and demonstrate competency under therapist supervision before implementation.
- All therapy activities must be documented in the resident’s health record and include:
- Type, discipline of service, and total minutes
- Resident engagement and response
- Refusals to participate or required modifications
- Total therapy time, including days and total minutes of active participation during the lookback period, must also be captured in the interRAI assessment.
- The therapist or designate must monitor progress and reassess interventions based on resident performance, level of participation, and changes in health or functional status using the Restorative Needs Assessment & Evaluation.
- Therapists must receive training and ongoing support on the use of the electronic health record and assessments, including interRAI, to ensure adherence with applicable standards and organizational policy and procedures.
- Therapists should participate in care conferences, plan of care reviews, and RCCC meetings. If unable, progress updates and recommendations must be shared for the team to review.
- The OT/PT or designate must complete the Restorative – Powered Mobility Devices Indoor Driving Assessment for residents requesting use of powered mobility devices.
- The plan of care must be updated for residents determined safe and competent and the Power-Mobility Agreement must be completed for such residents, then reviewed annually or upon the occurrence of any significant change.
- Incidents involving powered devices trigger reassessment and review of the continued use or consideration for an alternative mobility device.
- Specialized rehab services may be adapted based on availability (e.g., delivered in-house, via contract providers, or virtual consultation). If delayed or unavailable, the Clinical Restorative Care Co-Lead will work with the team to implement interim strategies.
