### Managers or Designate:

1. Assemble teams from all departments and agree on a date and time for the inventory count that works for everyone.

3. On the day of the inventory count, assign the areas for which each team will be responsible, including:
- Resident rooms/washrooms (check all closets and drawers);

- Nursing care carts;
- Linen rooms on home areas and tub/spa areas;
- Clean linen area in the laundry;
- Resident's wheelchairs, therapeutic chairs, walkers; and
- Other home areas where linens may be found (dining areas, beauty salon, etc.).

5. Inform registered staff that there will be no movement of linen allowed during the count unless there is an emergency. Let them know when the count is completed on their home area.
6. Have your teams record the inventory on the worksheets as it is counted. See Tools – Inventory Worksheet.
