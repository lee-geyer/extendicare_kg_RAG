### Prevention and Management Program

## PROCEDURE

- Upon move-in, residents will be screened for pressure ulcer risk using a validated tool, including a review of skin history and risk factors and through completion of the interRAI assessment.
- A comprehensive total body skin exam will be conducted, focusing on areas such as skin surface, folds, bony prominences, nails, and hair, and documenting wound characteristics such as size, depth, and signs of infection. The total body assessment will be completed:
- Within 24 hours of move-in
- Upon return from the hospital or leave of absence greater than 24 hours
- With a significant change in status affecting skin integrity
- Assessment outcomes will inform an individualized plan of care outlining preventative measures such as repositioning at a minimum of every 2 hours for residents unable to reposition independently, pressure-relieving devices, and measures that support skin hygiene and moisture balance.
- The home will have a process in place for obtaining photos of new or worsening skin conditions for reassessment, which will be recorded in the resident’s health record.
- Skin alteration classification and treatment protocols (e.g., cleaning, debridement, dressings) will be based on consultation with the physician/nurse practitioner, wound care lead, and Extendicare’s preferred vendors, where applicable.
- Unregulated care providers will inspect residents’ skin during daily care, including residual limbs or amputation sites, for signs of irritation, reporting any pain or skin integrity concerns to the nurse for reassessment and revision to the plan of care.
- The nurse will complete additional assessments associated with skin integrity changes where applicable (e.g., continence, pain) or initiate referrals as determined necessary to other interdisciplinary team members (e.g., physiotherapy/occupational therapy).
- Where the home has a Registered Dietitian (RD), a referral will be initiated when skin conditions may benefit from nutritional intervention, such as pressure injuries, foot ulcers, surgical wounds, burns, or deteriorating skin conditions in accordance with provincial regulations and standards.
