## POLICY

Extendicare fosters a safe living environment through the delivery of person-centred care for residents living with mental health conditions, including dementia and responsive behaviours, by engaging in a culture that recognizes and values residents as unique individuals while adhering to regulatory requirements, accreditation standards and best practices.

----

## STANDARD

- Comprehensive, validated assessments will be conducted for all residents upon move-in and as needed, incorporating input from all care providers to determine each resident’s physical and mental health history, mood, responsive behaviours, psychosocial and well-being.

- Extendicare will support residents to maintain their autonomy and ability to participate in decision-making through the creation of a person-centred plan of care developed in collaboration with the resident and/or Substitute Decision Maker (SDM) or Power of Attorney (POA), if any, and any other persons designated by the resident or SDM/POA to ensure preferences are incorporated in the provision of care.

- Non-pharmacological approaches will be prioritized. Interventions will be documented in the health record and evaluated to monitor their effectiveness to adjust care approaches, as necessary. Validated tools will be utilized but are not limited to assessments found in the electronic record under Mental Health.

- Medications, including antipsychotics, may be appropriately prescribed by the physician/nurse practitioner for the management of mental health conditions.

- The home will designate a registered staff member as the Behavioural Support Lead (BSL) for effective oversight of the program, including coordination of training and consultation with external supports where available.

- Education will be provided upon hire and annually on the assessment and management of mental health conditions, including dementia and responsive behaviour management.

- Annual program evaluation will be conducted.

- Homes will operate specialized and secure units in accordance with provincial regulations and standards.
