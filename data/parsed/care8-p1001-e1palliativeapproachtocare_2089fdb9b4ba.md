## Palliative Approach to Care

### Palliative Care: A Philosophy and Approach to Enhanced Quality of Life
Palliative care is a philosophy and approach designed to improve the quality of life for individuals with life-limiting illnesses and their families. It focuses on preventing and relieving suffering through the early identification, assessment, and treatment of symptoms. Palliative care spans the entire illness trajectory, from diagnosis and treatment to end-of-life care and bereavement support.

In long-term care, a palliative approach ensures that residents with life-limiting illnesses can experience a high quality of life from admission to the end of their lives. This approach facilitates the transition from chronic disease management to end-of-life care, emphasizing the alignment of care with residents' values and preferences.

By complementing restorative care, palliative care provides comfort and dignity throughout the later stages of life, becoming the central focus when needed to ensure holistic support for residents and their families.

### Model of Palliative Approach to Care in LTC
| Transition (PPS 60%-40%) | EOL (PPS 30%-10%) |
|---------------------------|--------------------|
| Restorative care          | Complement Death    |
|                           | Transition EOL care  |
|                           | Bereavement         |
| Admission                 | Time                |
|                           | Resident's Death    |

Upon admission, many residents already experience significant functional decline, often corresponding to a Palliative Performance Scale (PPS) score of 60% or lower. For this reason, a palliative approach to care often begins at the time of admission.

While many residents require a palliative approach, restorative care remains a crucial and achievable goal for many upon admission. These approaches—restorative and palliative—are not mutually exclusive. Instead, they complement each other, focusing on advanced care planning, improving quality of life, controlling symptoms, and addressing psychological and spiritual needs. Restorative care provides tangible benefits to most residents. Some individuals even regain enough functionality to be discharged home.

# Palliative Approach to Care

## Palliative Approach Assessment: Key Questions
- Would you be surprised if the resident died within the next year?
- Have there been hospital admissions recently?
- Are there distressing physical or psychological symptoms?
- What are the goals of care? What is the resident’s/family’s understanding of the disease processes, prognosis, and treatment options?
- Are there significant social or spiritual concerns affecting daily life? (Limited social support)
- Has the resident and family (if applicable) participated in advance care planning?
- Has resuscitation been discussed?

## Palliative Approach Sample Criteria
- Not surprised if resident died within 12 months
- Difficult to control physical or psychological symptoms
- More than one admission to hospital in the last several months
- Complex care requirements
- Decline in function, food and fluid intake, and unintended weight loss
- Cognitive impairment
- Disease-specific markers (e.g., hepatic disease, cancer, heart disease, pulmonary disease, renal disease, dementia)

## Recommended Palliative Staging
| PPS Level   | Description   |
|-------------|---------------|
| 70%-100%    | Stable        |
| 40%-60%     | Transitional  |
| 10%-30%     | End-of-Life   |
