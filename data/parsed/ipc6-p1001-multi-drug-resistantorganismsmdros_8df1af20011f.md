## POLICY
### Multi-Drug-Resistant Organisms (MDROs)

## PROCEDURE

### Screening
- Ongoing screening/surveillance cultures will be collected based on local laboratory instructions and health authority guidelines.
- The IPAC - MDROs Screening Tool (Multi Drug Resistant Organism) in PointClickCare (PCC) or the MDROs Admission and Readmission Screening Tool are to be used for all resident admissions and re-admissions into the Home.

### Management
- In the event a resident is positive for an MDRO, the registered staff will:
- Notify the Infection Control Professional/Designate in the Home.
- For an MDRO infection or colonization, implement contact precautions (if required) in addition to Routine Practices and as per health authority guidelines.
- Post signage and provide residents, families, visitors, and staff information regarding any additional precautions to take and any personal protective equipment (PPE) that should be worn.
- Refer to appropriate MDRO procedure.
- Dedicate equipment for individual resident use if possible. If equipment cannot be dedicated, it must be cleaned and disinfected with an approved disinfectant before use on another resident.
- If a resident with an MDRO colonization or infection is to be transferred, the MDRO status will be communicated to the receiving site and transport service personnel before the transfer.
- Consider placing the infected resident in a room with a resident without an MDRO if the risk of spreading the organism is low when a single room is not possible. Do not, where possible, place a resident with a MDRO infection or colonization in a room with a resident who is palliative or debilitated (requiring considerable amounts of hands-on care) or who has other compromising medical conditions such as open wounds/ulcers, urinary catheters, feeding tubes or invasive devices or compromised hygiene.

### Treatment or Decolonization
- Treatment or decolonization of an MDRO will be determined by the attending physician/nurse practitioner in consultation with the Home and/or based on health authority requirements and guidelines. Decolonization is not supported by best practices.
- Specific interventions related to care and treatment of a resident with an MDRO colonization or infection will be documented on the care plan.

### Surveillance and Reporting
- Reporting of MDRO colonization or infection will be conducted as per health authority requirements.
- Tracking and surveillance of MDRO infections and colonizations will be conducted in HealthConnex or using the Multi-Drug Resistant Organism (MDRO) Tracking Sheet and as per regional/provincial requirements.
- A consistent system for flagging/deflagging MDRO status on Residents’ health records will be established in the Home based on health authority requirements.

### Discontinuation of Precautions
- Discontinue additional precautions based on clinical symptoms, culture results, and health authority guidelines in consultation with the Infection Control Professional/Designate.

#### Retirement Specific:
- If an MDRO is identified, it will be noted on the plan of care. Appropriate precautions will remain in place until the identified MDRO is cleared, or the resident moves out.

#### Alberta and Manitoba Specific:
- Admission and clearance testing are not recommended.
- Assessment of the MDRO positive resident to determine the need for Additional Precautions will be performed by the Home using provincial guidance.
