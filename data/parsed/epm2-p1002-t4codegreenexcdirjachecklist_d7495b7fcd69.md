## Code Green Executive Director/Designate Job Action Checklist

*Note: You may edit this job action checklist to be home specific.*

### Respond
- [ ] Seek updates from Incident Manager to determine actions. If you are the Incident Manager, refer to the Incident Manager checklist and designate responsibilities accordingly.
- [ ] Upon being notified by the Incident Manager that a Code Green full evacuation has been determined and that additional staff is required, start calling staff from the most current staff call-back list.
**Note:** Begin calling based on staff who live closest to the home.
- [ ] Advise staff to ensure they have identification with them when responding to the staff call-back.
- [ ] If residents are being evacuated out of the home, you must call IT to activate emergency access on Point Click Care:
Call IT at 905-470-5611
Tell the help desk that you need PCC remote access enabled for your home.
Tell the help desk this is an EMERGENCY SITUATION, and your call needs to be escalated to the Application Support Team IMMEDIATELY. This step is imperative to ensure your access is granted as soon as possible.
- [ ] Notify the Regional Director and Health authority of the situation and keep them updated.
- [ ] Assist with evacuation as required as per evacuation procedures below.

## EVACUATION PROCEDURES
1. Staff members will be designated to be on the outer side of the fire doors taking received residents, or to go room to room evacuating residents. Try to have the same number of people receiving residents at the fire door as teams evacuating residents from rooms (for example, you have 9 staff members, 3 will receive residents at the fire doors and 6 will be broken into teams to evacuate rooms).
2. All staff who are going room to room must be in teams of two. Teams enter rooms and bring resident(s) to the closest fire doors.
3. Staff waiting on the other side of fire doors take the residents to safety.
4. After a team has confirmed there are no residents in a room, they close the door and flag the room as empty.
5. Steps 1-3 continue until all the residents in the affected area have been evacuated.

### Order of Evacuation
1. Ambulatory residents; residents who can walk with little assistance.
