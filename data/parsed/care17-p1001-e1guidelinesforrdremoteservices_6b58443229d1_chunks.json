      "text": "# Extendicore Guidelines for Registered Dietitian Remote Services## Purpose:\n- To provide residents with uninterrupted nutrition care and services. - To provide guidelines for safe remote/virtual Registered Dietitian (RD) services if onsite services cannot be provided.For homes that have RD services, the RD will provide onsite services to meet, at minimum, provincial legislation. If the staff RD is not available to work on his/her originally scheduled day, the first step would be rescheduling or choosing an alternative day to be onsite and/or arranging alternative on-site coverage by a non-staff RD. A written backup plan is only required if the home RD cannot be onsite to meet the minimum 30 minutes per resident per month requirement as required by the applicable provincial legislation.## If unable to work Onsite, the staff RD will:\n- Inform the Executive Director and Nutrition/Dietary Manager (N/DM). - In collaboration with the home, create a back-up plan that identifies actions and strategies taken to comply with the onsite requirement as per applicable provincial legislation. - If the back-up plan fails, the staff RD can work remotely by means of telephone or video conferencing.",
