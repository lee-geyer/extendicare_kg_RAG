# Hand Hygiene: A Key to Preventing Infection

Did you know that the main way germs can spread is by hands? Hand cleansing (also called hand hygiene) is one of the best ways you and your health-care team can prevent infection from spreading.

## Your Healthcare Team Should Clean Their Hands:

- Every time they enter your room or come to your bedside
- Before putting on gloves
- After removing gloves

## You Can Clean Your Hands in 2 Different Ways!

1. With soap & water
2. With alcohol-based hand rub (sanitizer)

### When to Use Soap and Water:

- When your hands are visibly dirty
- After using the bathroom
- Before you eat and prepare food

### Don’t Be Shy… You Can Make a Difference in Your Own Health!

Your health-care team knows they should wash their hands, but they sometimes forget. They will welcome your friendly reminder to wash their hands.

### When to Use Hand Sanitizer:

- When your hands don’t look dirty
- When soap and water are not available

Don’t be shy to tell your visitors to stay home if they aren’t feeling well. That’s another big way we can prevent infections from spreading in our home.
