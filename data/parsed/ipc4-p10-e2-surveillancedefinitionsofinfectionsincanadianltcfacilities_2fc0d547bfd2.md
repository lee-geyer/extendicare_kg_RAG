## Surveillance Definitions for Respiratory Tract Infections (Respiratory)

**NOTE:** During outbreaks, suspect cases that meet sign and symptom criteria, but lack a confirmatory laboratory test, may be considered a case if there is an epidemiological link to a laboratory-confirmed case.

| Type                                           | Algorithm/Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

# Lung Examination Abnormalities

## Criteria for Lower Respiratory Tract Infection

### All three criteria must be present:
1. Chest radiograph not performed or negative results for pneumonia or the presence of a new infiltrate or consolidation
- **No/Negative Chest X-Ray**
2. At least 2 of the following respiratory subcriteria:

3. At least one of the constitutional criteria (see Table 1, page 1)

## Table 3. Surveillance Definitions for Urinary Tract Infections (UTI)

**NOTE:** A urinalysis negative for leukocytes effectively rules out a UTI. A urinalysis positive for leukocytes does not differentiate a UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria.

| Type | Algorithm |
|------|-----------|
| UTI  | Urinary Tract Infection (Symptomatic UTI) |
|      | For residents without an indwelling catheter, both criteria 1 and 2 must be present: |

|      |        - Gross Hematuria |
|      |        - New or Marked increase in Incontinence |
|      |        - New or Marked increase in Urgency |
|      |        - New or Marked increase in Frequency |
|      | 2. In the absence of Fever or Leukocytosis, then two or more of the following localizing urinary tract sub-criteria: |
|      |    - Acute Dysuria |
|      |    - Costovertebral Angle Pain |
|      |    - Suprapubic Pain |
