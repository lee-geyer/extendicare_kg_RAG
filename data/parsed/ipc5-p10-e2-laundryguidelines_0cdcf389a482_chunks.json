Alternatively, if few residents are isolated, double bagging (clear plastic bags) the red isolation laundry is needed before sending in the laundry chute or travelling with the soiled laundry through the home.\n- Wipe cart with disinfectant wipes before leaving the unit.### For Laundry Delivery:#### If Delivering Laundry Alone:",
