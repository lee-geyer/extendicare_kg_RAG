# Understanding Skin Integrity & Wound Types

## Why Healthy Skin Matters

Skin integrity refers to intact, healthy skin that serves as a barrier against harm.

### Common Wound Types Include:

| Wound Type                                   | Description                                      |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Pressure Injuries (Stages 1-4, Unstageable, Deep Tissue Injury – DTI) | Injuries caused by prolonged pressure on the skin. |
| Skin Tears, Bruises, Abrasions               | Various forms of skin damage due to trauma.      |
| Moisture-Associated Skin Damages (MASD)     | Injuries caused by excessive moisture on the skin. |
| Injuries caused by friction and shear        | Damage resulting from skin rubbing against surfaces. |

### Key Points:
- Healthy skin is crucial for overall health.
- Understanding different wound types helps in effective treatment and prevention.

# Pressure Injuries & PURS Overview

## Identifying and Preventing Pressure-Related Injuries

PURS (Pressure Ulcer Risk Scale) helps assess risk and guide preventive actions.

### Pressure Ulcer Stages:
| Stage | Description                          |
|-------|--------------------------------------|
| 1     | Redness, no open wound               |
| 2     | Shallow open ulcer                   |
| 3     | Full-thickness skin loss             |
| 4     | Extensive tissue loss                |
| Unstageable / DTI | Obscured or deep damage |

Pressure injuries result from unrelieved pressure, usually over bony areas.

### High-risk sites:
- Sacrum
- Heels
- Elbows
- Hips

Frequent repositioning and risk assessments help reduce occurrence.

# Common Skin Risks & Prevention Strategies

## Managing Friction, Shear, Moisture & Skin Tears

| **Friction**                     | **Shear**                          | **Moisture**                       | **Skin Tears**                     |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Rubbing of skin against surfaces  | Deeper injury from skin layers     | Exposure to urine, feces, sweat,  | Traumatic wounds common in older   |
| (e.g., linens or equipment)      | sliding in opposite directions,     | or wound drainage that weakens     | adults with fragile skin            |
| causing superficial damage        | often from improper repositioning   | skin (MASD risk)                  |                                    |

### Prevention Strategies:
- Gentle repositioning and proper transfer techniques
- Keep skin clean, dry, and moisturized
- Use barrier creams and absorbent products
- Dress residents in soft clothing and long sleeves
- Perform regular skin assessments
