## POLICY

### Palliative and End-of-Life Care

## PROCEDURE

The individualized palliative care approach, including the need for support services, will be identified for the development of an individualized plan of care, inclusive of physical, emotional, psychological, social, and spiritual interventions.

- The nurse/Palliative Lead must complete the Extendicare Palliative Assessment & My Care My Voice Summary for all residents following move-in, ensuring it is finalized before the 6-week care conference to support individualized care planning.
- The nurse/Palliative Lead must complete the Palliative Performance Scale (PPS) score within the palliative assessment to classify the resident's stage and category of illness to inform the most appropriate palliative care approach.

### Palliative Staging:

| PPS Score     | Palliative Stage          |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| 70%-100%      | Palliative Stage 1 - Stable |
| 40%-60%       | Palliative Stage 2 - Transitional |
| 10%-30%       | Palliative Stage 3 - End of Life |

- The nurse/Palliative Lead must use the "My Care My Voice Summary" section within the Palliative Assessment to provide residents with an opportunity to express their advanced care decisions and future care preferences, including their choices for end-of-life care and treatment.
- Reasons to complete the Palliative Assessment & My Care My Voice Summary include:
- Initial Move-in
- Change in Condition
- Advance Care Planning Only
- Palliative Performance Scale (PPS) Only
- Re-assessments must be conducted following any “change in condition”, as indicated by a change in the CHESS score during the quarterly interRAI assessment. This ensures that improvements in health stability or signs of progressive decline are addressed, and the palliative approach is revised as needed.
- The interdisciplinary team must focus on pain and symptom management to enhance quality of life, while maintaining dignity and respect. They must develop personalized nutrition and hydration plans, considering nutritional care policies. The team must also look to address spiritual, cultural, and religious needs of the residents. Referrals must be completed as needed for additional assessments (e.g., dietician, spiritual care, restorative, physio) based on the resident's needs.
