## POLICY
### Nutritional Care and Hydration

## PROCEDURE

### Interdisciplinary Team Approach
- An interdisciplinary team approach must be in place to assess and manage chewing and swallowing difficulties.
- Care staff must report any chewing, swallowing, or feeding difficulties to the nurse.
- If a resident is having difficulty swallowing or appears to be choking, staff must:
- Remain with the resident.
- Direct another staff member to call the nurse to assist the resident immediately.
- The nurse must:
- Respond to all incidents of choking immediately.
- Provide the necessary emergency interventions.
- Implement the Code Blue protocol as appropriate.
- After the resident has been stabilized, transfer the resident to the hospital, if necessary.
- The nurse will document all episodes of choking or aspiration in the progress notes and initiate a Referral – Registered Dietitian.

#### Manitoba Specific:
- Refer to: WRHA Policy # 110.130.010 ~ Feeding and Swallowing Management of Residents in Long Term Care
- The interdisciplinary team must ensure the resident/Substitute Decision Maker (SDM)/Power of Attorney (POA) has the information and the opportunity to make informed choices about the resident’s well-being and quality of life.

### Referral and Assessment
- A meal observation occurs upon move-in and whenever there is a significant change in the resident’s health status.
- Upon move-in, if a resident has a history of chewing or swallowing difficulty or a diagnosis of dysphagia, they must be referred to the Registered Dietitian (RD) for assessment. The RD may refer to the Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) for a more comprehensive swallowing evaluation as necessary.

### Assessment of Assistive Feeding Devices
- Assessment may be completed by the RD, Occupational Therapist (OT), Physiotherapist (PT), or Restorative Care program lead as needed.

#### Manitoba Specific:
- Residents entering the home shall be screened by the nurse/designate for feeding and swallowing difficulties within 72 hours of move-in using the Meal Observation Screening Tool.
- Any indicators of swallowing difficulties will result in a Swallowing Assessment Referral to the SLP for a comprehensive swallowing evaluation.

#### Alberta Specific:
- In the absence of a home RD, a regulated health professional, such as the nurse, must assess the resident for the need for nutrition interventions related to chewing, swallowing, and feeding.
- If interventions are required or appear to be required, the regulated health professional must make a referral to an external SLP for assessment.

### Plan of Care
- In consultation with the SLP (as required), and the resident/SDM/POA, the RD/delegate must initiate/update the plan of care as required.
- Medication may be adjusted according to swallowing needs in consultation with the pharmacist and/or physician.
- If a resident experiences difficulty eating, drinking, or swallowing, the nurse must initiate a Referral – Registered Dietitian.
- The nurse can only downgrade the resident’s diet texture and/or liquid (fluid) consistency temporarily until further assessment is completed by the RD/SLP.
- A resident’s diet texture and/or liquid consistency can only be upgraded after an assessment has been completed by the RD/SLP/physician and prescribed diet orders have been confirmed.

### Communication and Education
- Identified feeding and safe swallowing interventions must be communicated to all members of the interdisciplinary team and documented in the resident’s plan of care.
- The interdisciplinary team members must inform the resident/SDM/POA of any recommended changes in diet texture or liquid consistency and the reason for the changes.
- The resident’s/SDM’s/POA’s informed decision to accept or refuse further assessment and interventions must be documented on the resident’s plan of care.
- If any resident/SDM/POA refuses the recommended interventions, the interdisciplinary team, specifically the RD/SLP/physician, must explain the risks associated with this decision and must document both the resident’s/SDM’s/POA’s refusal and the education provided in the resident’s plan of care.
- If oral intake is assessed to be unsafe for a resident, the resident/SDM/POA and the interdisciplinary team must discuss other intake options.
- Safe feeding assistance training must be provided to staff/volunteers involved with the care of residents with dysphagia.
