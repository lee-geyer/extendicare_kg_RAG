## POLICY

### Privacy and Confidentiality Program

## BACKGROUND

During emergency situations where police and/or emergency services must be called to maintain the safety of residents or staff, it may be necessary for the Executive Director to release information without the prior written consent of the resident. For example, if a resident is being aggressive and is threatening physical harm to themselves or any other individual, and it is felt that the resident plans to follow through on those threats, it may be necessary to release personal information related to the resident, such as diagnosis, in order to provide the necessary information to police and/or emergency services to help them manage the situation.

## PROCEDURE

The Head Office/Executive Director/Director of Care or Delegate will:

1. Provide only the necessary information to the police/emergency services during an emergency situation to maintain the safety of the residents, staff, and all others in the home.
2. Contact Privacy_Officer@extendicare.com and Regional Director/Operations prior to the release of any additional information to the police.
3. Contact Privacy_Officer@extendicare.com and Regional Director/Operations if served with a production order or subpoena to produce a health record. See the Court Order for Release of Records procedure.
