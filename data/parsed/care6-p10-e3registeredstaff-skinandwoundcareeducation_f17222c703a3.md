- Rapidly appearing skin breakdown associated with the dying process
- Typically occurs on the sacrum or coccyx
- Irregular shape, often pear-shaped or butterfly-shaped
- Colors range from red, purple, brown, black
- Progresses quickly—may appear suddenly and worsen within hours or days
- Not preventable and not an indicator of poor care
- Reflects multi-organ failure and diminished perfusion during end-of-life

# Wound Assessment

## Overview

### Initial Assessment:
When a wound is identified, its characteristics will be documented in the respective wound assessment tool.

### Weekly Re-evaluation:
During the weekly re-evaluation, the nurse on shift will update the wound's characteristics in the weekly wound assessment.

#### Comparison for Deterioration:
- Compare the current assessment with previous ones to detect any signs of wound deterioration.

##### Immediate Action:
- If identified as failing to improve:
- Send referral to lead
- Involve the interdisciplinary collaboration
- Notify MD/NP
- Revise Plan of Care
