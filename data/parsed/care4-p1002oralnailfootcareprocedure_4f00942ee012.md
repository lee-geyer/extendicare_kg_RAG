## PROCEDURE

### Oral Health
- The Nurse will complete and review oral health assessments using the Oral-Health Assessment Tool (OHAT) upon:
- Resident move-in
- Changes in oral health status
- A referral to an oral health professional (physician/dentist) will be initiated when additional assessment or medical intervention is needed.
- Resident’s oral and dental care needs will be documented in the care plan, with oral care provided at least twice daily, including denture cleaning/rinsing as applicable and supervision if there is an aspiration risk.
- A visual check of the resident’s mouth will be conducted prior to daily oral care and any abnormalities or changes in oral health, including lost dentures or partial plates will be reported to the nurse for reassessment and revision of the plan of care as needed.

### Nail Care
- Fingernails, toenails, and feet will be inspected during the resident's regular bath and personal hygiene routine, with nail care provided based on individual needs and preferences as outlined in the plan of care.
- Nail clippers are designated for single-resident use and labeled with the resident’s name. The clippers will be disinfected with disinfectant wipes and stored in a labeled organizer.

### Foot Care
- Unregulated Care Providers (UCPs) will provide routine toenail trimming and foot care, unless otherwise specified in the plan of care for non-diabetic residents.
- A qualified foot care provider will perform toenail trimming for diabetic residents and other identified residents.
