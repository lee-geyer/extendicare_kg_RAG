## Influenza Preparedness Checklist

To be completed by IPAC Manager/ICSA, in collaboration with other departments (e.g., DOC, ADOC, Nurse in Charge, Clinical Coordinator, etc.) or designate.

### August/September
- [ ] Refer to the 5 Steps to an Effective Immunization Program to help with pre-planning for influenza immunization program.
- [ ] Audit the vaccine fridge for unused or expired influenza doses - follow your regional health authority (RHA) or local Public Health Authority (PHA) guidelines for disposal/return.
- [ ] Confirm vaccine ordering timeline with RHA or local PHA.
- [ ] Current serum creatinine (recent blood work) to be completed unless done in the previous three months to a year (confirm with your RHA or local PHA & pharmacy provider). This will be used to calculate the creatinine clearance to determine appropriate Tamiflu® (Oseltamivir) dosing.
- **MANITOBA:** Record resident information (name, PHIN, birthdate, gender, serum creatinine and date of test) on the revised LTC Oseltamivir Dosing and Vaccination Tracking 2023-2024 spreadsheet which will automatically calculate appropriate oseltamivir doses for both treatment and prophylaxis of influenza. Ensure the spreadsheet is updated with each new admission/discharge.
- [ ] Obtain informed consent for residents. Consent forms are provided by the IPAC Corporate team with current components listed within. (Note: reach out to your Corporate IPAC Consultant for up-to-date information on consents).
- **MANITOBA:** Use the COVID-19, Influenza, and Pneumococcal Immunization Consent Form to document informed consent.
- [ ] Distribute and collect Employee Influenza Intention Forms to all staff. Use this information to plan and order influenza vaccine doses.
- [ ] Collaborate with the management team to update staff lists (e.g., remove the names of staff that are no longer with the home, flag staff who are on LOA, etc.). The staff list will be used to calculate the immunization rate of staff in the home.

### September
- [ ] Ensure resident informed consents are received and reviewed for completion and document in Point Click Care (PCC) under the resident immunization tab.
- [ ] If there are resident refusals, consider re-education and re-approaching POAs and residents. Utilize the Extendicare or provincially provided educational material (as applicable) to POAs and residents. Your IPAC Consultant can assist you.
- [ ] If there are staff refusals identified on the Employee Influenza Intention Forms, re-approach. Utilize the Extendicare or provincially provided educational material (as applicable) to staff. Your IPAC Consultant can assist you.
- **MANITOBA:** Ensure Long Term Care Oseltamivir Dosing Vaccination Tracking is accessible for staff (electronic version or printed version). In the event of an outbreak, the number of required doses/boxes of Tamiflu® are communicated to regional pharmacy/vaccine warehouse.
- **ONTARIO AND ALBERTA:** Confirm with your local Pharmacy Provider that Tamiflu® dosing has been established for each resident in the home and referenced in the clinical chart and under special instructions in PCC.
- **ONTARIO AND ALBERTA:** Confirm with your local Pharmacy Provider/Emergency Pharmacy that an adequate amount of Tamiflu® is available in case of any outbreak and/or emergency use.
