## Actionable Steps to Prevent Falls

We are committed to creating a safe and dignified home environment and providing the support you need to live your best life. Our collaborative approach, involving you, your family, and the healthcare team, is key to enhancing safety and positive experiences. Here are some ways to work together to reduce falls and ensure a safe living space.

### Room Area
- ◻ Always ensure a clear, well-lit pathway in the room.
- ◻ The telephone and electrical cords are away from the walking path.
- ◻ The overbed table is across the bed when not used.
- ◻ The call bell, water pitcher, cup, Kleenex, remote, grabber, trash can, and other personal items are reachable.
- ◻ No lightweight furniture, carpets, and other trip-hazardous items.
- ◻ Report all safety concerns immediately, such as spills, loose rails, poor lighting, and broken equipment.
- ◻ Remove items from the room that are no longer needed to de-clutter (work with the team to develop a plan if required).
- ◻ Always let the care staff know when you need assistance.
- ◻ The staff will ask you four questions before they leave your room:
- ◻ Do you have any pain or discomfort?
- ◻ Do you need anything before I leave?
- ◻ Are you comfortable?
- ◻ Do you need to use the washroom?

### Clothing and Footwear
- ◻ Choose shoes and slippers that fit well and have a firm shape, ensuring comfort and safety. Footwear should have a low, even heel and tread on the sole. If you're unsure, don't hesitate to ask the staff for support.
- ◻ If you cannot wear safe shoes or slippers, ask for gripper socks instead. These socks have a non-slip sole, providing better traction and reducing the risk of slipping.
- ◻ Use gripper socks at night.
- ◻ Ensure your clothing is well-fitted. Pants and robes below the ankle are a trip hazard.
- ◻ Consider protective equipment, such as hip protectors, to prevent injury if a fall occurs.

### Transfer and Bathroom
If you're unsure about getting out of bed, always call for help. We're here to ensure your safety during every step of your day.
- ◻ If you are unsteady, you will need help from the staff when moving from bed to a chair.
- ◻ Be sure to lock the brakes before getting in or out of a wheelchair.
- ◻ Consider wearing easy-to-manage clothing such as elastic band pants, pull-on skirts and dresses, and items with Velcro fasteners. These types of clothing are easier to put on and take off, reducing the risk of tripping or falling during dressing and undressing.
- ◻ Always use the seating items that have been recommended for you.

## Precautions for Low Blood Pressure
- ◻ The team will work with you to ensure your wheelchair is fitted correctly.
- ◻ Ensure you are constantly using your mobility aids and that they fit correctly (walker, cane, etc.).
- ◻ Before leaving your bed, sit on the edge and dangle your feet for a few minutes.
- ◻ Flex your feet backwards several times while sitting.
- ◻ Do not tilt your head backwards when you are sitting at the edge of the bed.
- ◻ When sitting for a while, get up slowly and use assistance.
- ◻ Report any dizziness.

## What is the Least Restraint Policy?
Extendicare has the least restraint policy, which means we will use restraints temporarily when health and safety are at immediate risk, and no other alternatives are unavailable. A restraint is defined as any measure or equipment that you cannot remove yourself and limits your ability to move freely or access parts of your body that you cannot reach easily. Examples of restraints include seatbelts, tilt chairs, wheelchairs with fixed tray tables, foam pillows, bed rails, and hand mitts. Some medications may also be considered restraints. Due to the potential for restraints to cause harmful consequences, such as functional decline, pressure ulcers, confusion, and even death, they are used with caution.

- ◻ You will notice that most residents can be in bed safely without bed rails, but talk to the home, as lowering the bed close to the floor and/or using fall mats is possible.
- ◻ You and your family/substitute decision-maker have the right to discuss safety options for the care plan, and consent will be obtained.

## Partner for Resident Safety
- ◻ When you move in, tell the staff about past falls or things that may cause you to fall.
- ◻ We want to understand your needs and preferences. Your feedback is essential in creating a care plan that ensures your safety and well-being. We are here to listen.
- ◻ Attend care conferences to ask questions and discuss what strategies work.
- ◻ Families and friends who visit often or when a companion care person is involved increase social activity, which is also a proven method of fall prevention.
