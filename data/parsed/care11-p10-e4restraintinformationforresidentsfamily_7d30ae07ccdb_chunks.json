We provide you with a safe and dignified home environment guided by a philosophy of “least restraint.” Our long-term care (LTC) home aims to avoid restraints, as we recognize the potential harm they can cause. We organize our care and services to ensure your safety and security while honouring your right to independence and dignity. Our goal is to create a caring and minimally restrictive atmosphere where you can make choices that support your safety and well-being to the greatest extent possible.### Resident Rights\nYou have the right to be informed and consent to specific risks to maintain your independence. Sometimes, a team assessment concludes that restraint is necessary to ensure safety or prevent harm to others. Any use of a restraint must be minimized to the least possible and should allow a person as much freedom of movement and expression as feasible.### Types of Restraints\n- **Physical Restraints:** Limit a person’s movement using devices or equipment (e.g., seatbelt, tabletop/lap tray, tilt feature on a wheelchair when engaged, bedrails).",

Your involvement is crucial to a positive experience. - Moving into a long-term care home can be challenging. It helps to spend time with family and friends. - Share what makes a good or bad day for you or your loved ones, such as things that upset them, including early awakenings, hunger, thirst, or pain. - Bring familiar items or photos from home. - Take daily walks to support your physical and emotional well-being.",
