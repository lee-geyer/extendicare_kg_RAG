# CODE RED
## Emergency Response

### What does it mean?
Code Red is the designated phrase used to alert staff to smoke and/or fire and to initiate an appropriate response in the case of a fire, fire alarm, or smell of smoke.

### What do I do?
Initiate the R.E.A.C.T sequence:
1. **Remove** persons from immediate danger
2. **E** if possible (evacuate)
- Ensure doors and windows are closed to confine fire and smoke
3. **Activate** the fire alarm system/use nearest pull station
4. **Call** the Fire Department - Dial 9-1-1
5. **Try to contain** (contain/extinguish) fire or concentrate on further evacuation
6. **Announce** 3 times, “Code Red + Location of fire”

### Review it before you need it:
- Refer to your Home’s Emergency Planning and Management Manual, Code Red and Fire Safety Plan
- Review the Code Red policy and Fire Safety Plan for procedures that describe your role if a fire occurs
