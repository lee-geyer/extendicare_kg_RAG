- In the event of a resident’s unexpected death, the nurse must:
- Leave everything as found
- Conduct a room sweep to secure the area and ensure privacy
- Contact Emergency services, the physician, DOC, and the coroner or other authorities as required.

- Dignity and respect must be maintained during the cleaning and handling of the resident’s body, and every effort made to accommodate the deceased’s religious, spiritual, or cultural customs as outlined in their plan of care.

- The body must be prepared for transfer to the funeral home in accordance with the resident’s advance care plan wishes.

- In the absence of pre-arranged funeral plans, the nurse must obtain the name of the funeral home to be contacted by the family for notification of death and arrangements for transportation of the body.
