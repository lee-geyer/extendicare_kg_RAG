## POLICY

### Personal Clothing and Linen Processes

## PROCEDURE

### Managers or Designate:

- Confirm with the Executive Director that funds are available for the purchase of a washer or dryer.
- Consult with the Extendicare Asset Management Department in choosing equipment and obtaining a quote. The Asset Management Department may issue a Purchasing Order to the supplier.
- Notify the Maintenance department head/designate of any new equipment acquisition.
- When choosing a washer/extractor for the home, consider the following factors:
- Production needs
- Ability to meet full load requirements
- Voltage requirements
- Space requirements
- Local repair service availability
- Mounting pad and drainage requirements
- Extraction requirements (high and low G force)
- Dryer units must be equipped with programmable features. Choose high-efficiency, fast-drying units when possible.
- When replacing equipment, consider purchasing reversible dryers, which greatly reduce the tangling of linen and allow for more airflow around/through linen.
