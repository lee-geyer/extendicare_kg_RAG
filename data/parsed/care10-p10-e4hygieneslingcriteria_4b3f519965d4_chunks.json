      "text": "# Special Instructions## Hygiene Sling Criteria1. **Hygiene sling should only be used for toileting tasks and not for day-to-day transfers.**\nKeep in mind these guidelines for use. When in doubt, try the resident in the sling in a controlled environment. Above the bed with extra staff present will allow you to observe what the resident will do without endangering yourself, or the resident. An inappropriate candidate will begin to slide through the sling. If a resident is being held up by the underarms, this is an indicator that the resident is not appropriate for the Hygiene sling. Another indicator of an inappropriate candidate is if tension on the lift and sling are needed to keep the resident seated upright on the commode or toilet; then this resident is not appropriate for the Hygiene sling. Another method for toileting will need to be found.2. **Resident should possess upper body/hip and head control.**\n(Bed edge sitting unassisted can be a suitable indicator)3.",
