## Risk Management Module (RMM) Overview

The Incident Manager is responsible to respond to the resident safety incident (RSI). The Incident Manager’s role will be assumed by the charge nurse or unit supervisor responding to the incident.

The Incident Manager is responsible for completing the initial incident report immediately after the incident or at the end of their shift. The report should contain factual, objective information. Avoid blame and speculation as to cause or fault of the incident.

After the initial incident information is recorded, the Executive Director and Director of Care/Wellness must review all incidents for accuracy, completion and add any pertinent notes or additions.

The Executive Director and Director of Care/Wellness is responsible to lock and sign all incident reports after completion. These incidents are available in the Historical tab of the Risk Management module.

Incident reports are maintained within the Risk Management module; they are not part of the resident chart.

After the Incident Report is complete, reports should be pulled to help determine root cause analysis surrounding the event. This analysis helps to develop proactive action plans to prevent future incidents or resident injuries.
