**Reporting Staff Member:**

### Respond
Upon seeing or being notified of a violent, aggressive or threatening individual in the home:

- [ ] Try to de-escalate or redirect the situation using words. Give the person space. If there are multiple staff members at the scene, have one staff member attempt to de-escalate the situation while the other staff member stands behind to assist in removing the speaking staff member from any direct contact as needed. It is best if only one staff member is talking and trying to de-escalate so they do not further agitate or confuse the aggressive individual. Remove objects from the area that can be used as weapons, ensure there is a clear exit route. If the aggressive individual can be calmed, a Code White does not need to be paged, and the police do not need to be called, the “All Clear” will be in effect. Review Tool 2, De-escalation Techniques, for assistance on how to de-escalate an aggressive situation.
- [ ] Never physically confront the agitated or aggressive individual, use action-oriented verbal communication and non-violent interventions to de-escalate the situation safely. Do not try to remove a weapon or subdue the person. Do not respond to threats.
- [ ] If the aggressive person is a resident, continue to monitor the situation for potential for re-escalation. Be prepared to intervene again using de-escalation techniques such as Gentle Persuasive Approach. Attempt to identify triggers and remove those triggers as soon as possible. Keep your tone of voice non-confrontational and volume level low.
- [ ] If anyone feels threatened, life endangered, there is a possibility of an escalation of violence, the individual has a weapon (initiate Code Silver) and/or the individual has taken a hostage (initiate Code Purple) remove yourself/others from the confrontation and call police, 9-1-1.
**Time called:** ________
- [ ] Direct staff to remove all persons from the area of the threat if safe to do so.
- [ ] Determine if any weapons are involved. Never confront someone with a weapon.
- [ ] Announce or designate a staff member to announce 3 times,
“Code White- location- stay away from location”
“Code White- location- stay away from location”
“Code White- location- stay away from location”
- [ ] Decide whether to enact the Incident Management System, if so, delegate IMS roles.
- [ ] Delegate a staff member to meet the police at the main entrance with directions, any background information and alternate access to the situation.
- [ ] Delegate a person to notify the Executive Director/ Designate if not already aware.
- [ ] Update the police within 5 minutes of the first call if they have not yet arrived.
- [ ] Ensure first aid is provided (when safe to do so; do not attempt to remove anyone who is hurt from the violent situation), and EMS (9-1-1) is called for any injuries.
