2. For sprinkler flow switches, indicate the time delay of flow indicator in the remarks column.
3. Sprinkler tamper switches cause a trouble condition to be annunciated but not an alarm condition.
4. Single-station smoke alarms are not part of the fire alarm system but testing of such devices may be required by the authority having jurisdiction.
