Delirium may be a medical emergency and warrants further assessment.### What are the risk factors for delirium?\n- Advanced age\n- Cognitive impairment/dementia\n- Medical illness (including infections, medication)\n- Medication changes\n- Hearing or vision impairments\n- Functional dependence (i.e., may lead to inadequate nutrition or hydration)\n- Depression\n- Alcohol misuse\n- Abnormal sodium levels in the blood\n- Males are at higher risk for delirium compared to females### What is the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)?\nThe CAM is a widely used tool for quickly identifying delirium. It assesses four key features:",

Engage the interdisciplinary team to consider the following:- **Physiological**:\n- Assess for physical causes of delirium (i.e., pain, infections, cardiovascular stability)\n- Consider diagnostic investigations (i.e., bloodwork, urine, chest x-ray, etc.)\n- Assess for symptoms of delirium (i.e., hallucinations or delusions that the resident is not known to normally exhibit)\n- Ensure bladder and bowel are working well\n- Assess for medications known to cause delirium\n- Monitor nutrition/hydration----This document is uncontrolled when printed.
