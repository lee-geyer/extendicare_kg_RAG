## POLICY

Immunization of residents and staff, including annual influenza, will reduce the risk of infection and complications for residents, staff, families, and volunteers. Residents will be offered vaccinations as per provincial, regional health authority, and public health unit recommendations at the time of admission and as per publicly funded vaccine schedules, to help minimize the spread of infection. A comprehensive vaccination history is also obtained for all residents admitted to the home.

Upon hire, staff will be asked to provide a copy of their immunization status showing dates of vaccination or evidence of immunity. Staff will provide results of their TB test completed in the past year as provincially required. Influenza vaccination will be offered to all staff annually; in the event of an outbreak, non-immunized staff will be required to follow public health directives.
