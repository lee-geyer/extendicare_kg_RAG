## POLICY
### Restorative Care

### PROCEDURE
Extendicare is committed to promoting each resident’s autonomy, dignity, and functional ability by supporting their active involvement in care planning and delivery. Nursing Rehabilitation is a key element of the restorative care philosophy, designed to optimize resident independence, maintain or improve functional capacity, and enhance quality of life.

- **Nursing Rehabilitation** is a nursing-led intervention focused on assisting residents to maintain or regain abilities in Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). It complements other restorative services (e.g., physical and occupational therapy) within a coordinated care approach.

- Interventions may include, but are not limited to:
- Dressing
- Personal hygiene
- Toileting
- Eating
- Transferring

- The **Associate Director of Care (ADOC)** or designate is the Nursing Rehabilitation Program Lead, ensuring:
- Clinical oversight and quality assurance
- Staff training in restorative care techniques
- Consistency with interRAI and provincial standards
- Integration with broader care goals and interdisciplinary collaboration.

- The interdisciplinary team must complete the comprehensive interRAI assessment according to associated timelines (i.e., move-in, quarterly, significant change in status).

- Upon reviewing triggered assessment protocols, quality indicators, outcome scales (e.g., ADL Self-Performance, Cognitive Performance Scale), and input from the resident and staff on perceived potential for functional gains, the nurse must initiate the **Restorative Coordinating Care Committee** referral for further assessment to determine eligibility.

- The **Restorative Care Co-Lead** or designate must complete the **Restorative – Needs Assessment & Evaluation**. They must then collaborate with the Restorative Care Coordinating Committee to confirm the resident’s potential and eligibility for restorative programming, based on evidence of their ability to improve, maintain, or slow the decline of function.

- The plan of care must be developed and goals of care established, integrating the resident’s values and preferences.

- Interventions must be carried out by **Unregulated Care Providers (UCPs)** or **Restorative Aides** trained in restorative techniques, under the direction and supervision of Registered staff, and in accordance with the plan of care.
