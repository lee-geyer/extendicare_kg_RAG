# Fire Safety Plan

## Introduction

All provinces in Canada have adopted the National Fire Code Act (NFCA) and National Building Code as the standard. However, each province manages compliance and sets its own penalties for non-compliance. This Fire Safety Plan is required by the National Fire Code and the Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, and Saskatchewan Provincial Fire Code Section 2.8:

This Fire Safety Plan is designed to provide occupant safety in the event of a fire, to provide effective utilization of the fire safety features of the building, and to minimize the possibility of fires. This plan discusses what occupants are to do in the event of a fire, fire safety, supervisory staff and related duties, and other related issues.

The Fire Safety Plan will also assist firefighters in the performance of their duties by providing floor plans, and building and resident information, if an emergency ever occurs.

## Corporate Fire Safety Plan Directive

In order for this plan to be effective, management and staff must know the Fire Safety Plan and be able to implement it in the event of a fire. The National and Provincial Fire Codes require the owner to be responsible for carrying out the provisions for fire safety (see Section 8 of this plan), and defines "owner" as "any person, firm or corporation controlling the property under consideration." Consequently, the owner may be any one of, or a combination of parties, including building management, maintenance staff, and tenant groups.

Each home is required to keep a copy of this Fire Safety Plan, as outlined in Section 2 of this plan. Homes are also required to store a copy in the Fire Safety Plan box. The Fire Safety Plan box is located in either the main lobby or main entrance of the home. In addition, a key to open the Fire Safety Plan Box must be mounted adjacent to the fire plan box in a separate and locked box.

All homes are required to adhere to all Extendicare policies outlined in the Emergency Preparedness manual. All Emergency Preparedness policies have been created using the highest standard across the national spectrum. As part of our continuous improvement, the Fire Preparedness manual policies are reviewed annually and where required, updated to reflect legislative and accreditation requirements and best practices.

Any person(s) who contravenes any provision of the provincial fire code and every director and/or officer of a corporation who knowingly concurs with such contravention is subject to the penalties outlined in the provincial fire code.

The Fire Safety Plan shall be reviewed, at minimum, once a year. The Chief Fire Official is to be notified regarding any subsequent changes in the approved Fire Safety Plan.

# Evacuation of Residents
## SECTION 9.0

### 1.0 Summary
The objective of an evacuation is to remove residents from danger in the shortest amount of time possible.

### 2.0 Risk Level
Any fire emergency situation is a progressive incident. This means that the longer it takes to isolate the source(s) of danger and evacuate residents, the greater the chances of someone being seriously injured.

For homes with a fire alarm system that operates in two stages, the first alarm is the **ALERT STAGE**. The Alert Stage activation signals a potential fire warning. The fire alarm bells will sound a long ring every 2 or 3 seconds. The second stage of the alarm is the **evacuation stage**, where the alarm bells will sound more rapidly to inform of the need to evacuate.

### 3.0 Evacuation Plan
As part of the Emergency Response Plan, there must be an evacuation plan that indicates the following:
1. Planned evacuation routes
2. Evacuation Centre location
3. Emergency Operations Centre (inside building)
4. Area of Refuge (outside building)
5. Assigned exits
6. Assessment and Treatment Centre location

### 4.0 Partial Evacuation
A partial evacuation must occur if the emergency situation can be contained to a specific area of the building that ensures the safety of all residents and employees.

#### 4.1 Evacuation Stages
Evacuation starts with removing residents from individual rooms to beyond a set of fire doors. Partial evacuation is carried out if the disaster itself can be contained in a particular area of the facility. If the safety of the residents cannot be ensured, total evacuation of the facility will be carried out, and this will be announced by putting the alarm system into second stage activation.

**STEP I FIRE ZONE** or partial evacuation is the initial response to the emergency situation. It involves removing residents from the room(s)/area threatened by the source of the disaster:
1. Room of emergency site

----

*Page 33 of 74*

```markdown
# Evacuation of Residents

## Step I: Initial Evacuation
1. Rooms on each side of the emergency site
2. Room directly across from emergency site

Evacuate these residents beyond fire/smoke separation doors to a safe area by Team and Chain Evacuation procedure outlined inside this plan. Consideration will be given to evacuation areas immediately adjacent, immediately above, and immediately below the fire.

**Note:** Fire evacuation routes are away from the fire. Depending on the fire situation, the amount of smoke, and the flow of traffic of the fire department, the Incident Manager may permit the movement of residents past the rooms with the fire if it is safe and more expedient to do so.

## Step II: Wing Evacuation
If a fire cannot be contained to a single fire zone, evacuate residents beyond the fire separation doors to another safe zone within the building (internal area of refuge). Residents in immediate danger should be moved first.

## Step III: Total Evacuation
Total evacuation occurs if smoke and/or fumes continue to spread throughout the facility, or the Incident Manager or Fire department gives the order to evacuate the entire building. The person giving the order should allocate exits to be used by various wings so that movement will be quick and orderly.

- Take residents to a safe distance away from the facility (Area of Refuge).
- Stay out of the way of emergency vehicles.
- Evacuate away from the fire area to the next zone and then out of the building or right to the closest exit, whichever is safer.
- Check to ensure evacuation of fire zone is complete.
- A one-way traffic flow should be maintained where possible.
- Tally resident count to verify that evacuation is complete.

**Note:** At this step, it is critical that the Transfer/Discharge system is initiated to a safe location or “area of refuge.”

## 5.0 Complete Evacuation
A STEP III, total evacuation must occur if the emergency situation cannot be contained to a specific area and/or the safety of all residents and employees cannot be ensured.

**Note:** At this step, the Incident Manager must utilize the Code Green Incident Manager Job Action Checklist.
```

# Evacuation of Residents

## 5.1 Authority To Order Evacuation

Authority and responsibility for the evacuation decision generally rests with the Incident Manager or Fire department (if present). Any Charge Nurse can order evacuation of their area if residents under their care are endangered by fire, smoke, or any other factor.

----

**Page 35 of 74**

# Procedure for Evacuation of Residents
## SECTION 9.1

Residents will be evacuated in a calm and orderly manner according to the evacuation plan. Employees are to guide Residents along the planned evacuation route(s). Resistive Residents will be evacuated last.

Rooms that have been evacuated must be flagged using the Home’s evacuation identification system.

### SUMMARY
Establish Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) – the most senior position (person) on site (that is not at the fire scene) must take charge of the EOC. It is located <Identify location> (i.e. reception desk/main lobby) or alternate site <identify location> (i.e. activity room/ Executive Director’s office).

### PROCEDURE

#### Decision To Evacuate
1. Assess the emergency situation and determine whether the incident requires a partial or total evacuation.
2. Initiate Incident Management System (IMS).
3. Determine and communicate evacuation route(s).
4. Convert the fire alarm system to the second phase to create a continuous ringing sound by the designated keyholder by inserting and turning the key to the right.
- **Note:** If the communication system(s) fail, send a runner to notify all employees of the code red emergency situation.
5. Identify and determine appropriate evacuation stages and evacuate the specific area where the emergency situation is occurring.
6. Call 911 immediately.
7. Liaise with authorities to determine:
- a. The end of the partial evacuation, or
- b. The need to call a complete evacuation.

#### Safety Leader
1. Direct Residents and employees to the Area of Refuge using planned evacuation routes.

----

**Page 36 of 74**

# Procedure for Evacuation of Residents

## Complete Evacuation

### Incident Manager
1. Determine the need for a complete evacuation.
2. Call EMS immediately.
3. Direct employees to evacuate all residents from the home.
4. Liaise with authorities and follow directions as required.

### Logistics Leader
1. Remove the following records from the building using linen hamper bags or carts:
- Resident Care Plans
- M.A.R. Books
- Resident Medical Charts (if applicable)
- L.O.A. Books
- Emergency Response Plan
- Disaster Box(es)
- MSDS Master Binder
- If possible, pictures of residents
2. Direct and organize residents and employees to the Area of Refuge. If required, use planned transportation.
**Note:** Ensure that emergency vehicles have an unobstructed path into the Home.

### Public Information Logistics Leader
1. Liaise with the Incident Manager and the Corporate Communications Department and follow directions as required.
2. Update employees, residents, family members, community leaders, and media as required.

----

**Page 37 of 74**

# Evacuation Procedures
## SECTION 9.2

### SUMMARY
To ensure a smooth process for evacuating residents during an emergency situation, residents will be moved in a calm and orderly manner during any code red or green emergency situation.

### PROCEDURE

#### Logistic Leader
1. Designate all staff members to either be on the outer side of the fire doors taking received residents, or to go room to room evacuating residents. Try to have the same number of people receiving residents at the fire door as teams evacuating residents from rooms (for example, you have 9 staff members, 3 will receive residents at the fire doors and 6 will be broken into teams to evacuate rooms).
2. Organize all staff members who are going room to room into teams of two.

#### Teams
1. Teams enter rooms and bring resident(s) to the closest fire doors.
2. Staff waiting on the other side of fire doors take the residents to safety.
3. After a team has confirmed there are no residents in a room they close the door and flag the room as empty.
4. Steps 1-3 continue until all the residents in the affected area have been evacuated.

----

**Page 38 of 74**

# Persons Requiring Assistance
## SECTION 9.3

In the event of a fire alarm, Residents will count on employees to provide some level of assistance.

Residents are to be classified as either ambulatory or non-ambulatory.

- **Ambulatory residents** are evacuated first unless other residents remain in immediate danger. The evacuees should be gathered and led in groups or in single file. Once the ambulatory residents have been evacuated, all other residents can be assisted.

- **Non-ambulatory residents** may be evacuated by wheelchair or by other wheeled conveyance. This is easiest and fastest for covering a distance but requires transferring the resident to a chair. Residents can be pulled from the bed onto a blanket and pulled along the floor. Blankets are usually readily available, but carpeted hallways make this very difficult. In this case, if two or more carriers are available, the blankets can be used as an improvised stretcher.

As a care facility, detailed files of each resident are maintained and kept readily available in the event of an emergency. Use the form attached to log which Residents needed assistance.

# Fire Drills
## SECTION 14.1

### 1.0 Summary
Fire Drills are to be performed monthly in each facility to provide employees with realistic training and practice in steps to take in the event of a fire. The Fire Department and the monitoring company will be notified of the fire drill before and after each fire drill. Contact the Fire Department `<NON-EMERGENCY NUMBER>` and the Monitoring Company at `<TELEPHONE NUMBER>` before conducting the fire drill and when the fire drill has been completed.

### 2.0 Frequency
Fire drills should simulate an actual fire emergency and will:
1. Be performed monthly on all shifts, in different locations and at different times.
2. Include practice in evacuation procedures and practice in the use of fire extinguishers and fire blankets.
3. Night drills may be conducted as silent drills requiring three annual drills with full bells.

### 3.0 Scheduling
The Executive Director or designate will organize and initiate the monthly drills on all shifts according to the pre-planned schedule. The effectiveness of these exercises can be supported through pre-planning. The schedule of drills must be incorporated into the Quality Service/Management Program. All employees are required to respond to each fire alarm as a real emergency. Fire drills should not occur in a pattern which allows employees to predict a drill. Drills will be a combination of announced and unannounced, ensuring employee training and practice. The Executive Director or designate will notify the fire department and monitoring company at the beginning and end of each fire drill.

Determining the fire drill schedule should consider the following variables:
1. Location
2. A/C power
3. D/C power
4. Bells ring
5. Silent
6. Time
