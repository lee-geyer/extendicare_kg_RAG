## POLICY
### Fall Prevention and Injury Reduction

## PROCEDURE
1. Upon discovering that a resident has fallen, staff should:
- Stop and scan the environment for safety hazards before approaching the resident.
- Call the nurse and remain with the resident.
- If the resident is unconscious, follow Extendicare’s emergency policies and procedures.
- Do not move the resident.
- Once the nurse assesses the resident and deems it safe, assist the resident off the floor using a mechanical lift and additional staff.

2. A Post-Fall Assessment must be completed by a nurse. This assessment includes:
- A post-fall huddle
- An evaluation of potential injuries
- A review of the events leading up to the fall
- Identification of environmental risk factors
- An analysis of contributing factors
- Determination of the probable root cause

3. Vitals signs must be monitored for a minimum of 72 hours. If the fall was unwitnessed or the resident hit their head, the Head Injury Routine must be initiated (hourly monitoring for 4 hours and once every shift after, for 72 hours after the fall).

4. After a fall, the nurse must review the resident’s most current fall risk level. If the resident is not already identified as high risk, the nurse must complete the Integrated Fall Risk Assessment to determine any changes in the resident’s risk level.

5. Individual goals must be reviewed with collaboration and engagement between the interdisciplinary team, including restorative and special rehabilitation services (allied health, PT, OT, etc.) as applicable, and resident/Substitute Decision Maker (SDM)/Power of Attorney (POA) to support the implementation of interventions aimed to support the resident with fall prevention and injury reduction strategies.

6. With resident/SDM/POA engagement, fall prevention strategies to reduce or mitigate falls must be trialed/implemented/removed as needed, and updates will be documented on the resident's individualized plan of care.

7. For residents deemed to be at high risk for falls, and/or upon clinical judgment, a Falling Star Logo will be placed in a standardized location in the home to indicate the risk.
