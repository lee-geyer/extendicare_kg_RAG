## Laundry Chemical Costs and Quality Guidelines

### Resident Room

Costs of processing are monitored monthly with the chemical representative who, upon request, provides a cost analysis report. Costs per pound should stay relatively stable as long as the load mix is consistent. When costs per pound are out of line, there should be an investigation into the processes that could influence chemical over-usage/costs.

Consider the following conditions which can affect chemical costs:
- Water conditions
- Improper loading
- Using incorrect formula cycles
- Low water temperatures
- Double washing
- Outbreaks (isolation formula used extensively)

Once the issue has been identified and corrective action taken, the costs should return to normal. Continue monitoring throughout the month to ensure the condition(s) and/or improper procedures are now corrected, and costs are back in line the following month. If an issue is related to incorrect processing, re-educate staff to ensure they are following correct procedures and monitoring.

### Quality Results

The control and management of the various laundry cycle variables is essential in producing a quality wash for all laundered items. There are five elements involved in this process: time, temperature, chemical action, mechanical action, and procedures. All combine to support this effort.

Each element involved in the process must be optimized to ensure a quality wash result. Less than optimal performance by any one of the five elements will require an increase in one or more of the other elements. Examples of poor quality include:
- Reducing temperature from 150 degrees in a wash cycle will create a need to increase chemical and possibly time (excluding Ozone system)
- Overloading of machine will create a need for more time
- Reducing normal time of formula will create the need to increase chemical
- Using the wrong formula will create the need to use more chemicals because of rewashing of rejects

The laundry staff is responsible for selecting the proper wash program, proper loading of the washing machines, and notifying the Manager/designate of poor washing results.
