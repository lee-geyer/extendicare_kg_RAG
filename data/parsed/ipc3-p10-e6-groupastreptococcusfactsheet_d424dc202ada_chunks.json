      "text": "## Group A Streptococcus Fact SheetGroup A Streptococci (GAS) are bacteria that are often found in the nose, throat and/or on the skin of healthy people.### How does GAS spread? These bacteria are spread through direct contact with secretions from the nose or throat of people who are infected (e.g., open mouth kissing, mouth to mouth resuscitation) or through contact with infected wounds or sores on the skin. Those who are ill with GAS are the most likely to spread it to others. People who carry the bacteria but have no symptoms are much less contagious. Treating an infected person with an antibiotic for 24 hours or longer generally eliminates their ability to spread the bacteria.### Symptoms and Illness\nMost people who get GAS will experience common infections such as sore (strep) throat, tonsillitis, and skin infections (e.g., impetigo, pyoderma). Less commonly a person may develop scarlet fever.Occasionally, GAS causes “invasive” infections, which can be severe and possibly life threatening.",
